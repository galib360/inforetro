                    <h2> GUILTY PLEA REPORTED IN SMUGGLING OF CHINESE INTO N.J. </h2>
                    <P>
                            NEWARK, N.J. _ Intensifying their investigation of the smuggling
                         of Chinese immigrants into the United States, a federal prosecutor
                         said Tuesday that one of the crew members of a smuggling ship that
                         ran aground in New Jersey had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges
                         and another was expected to plead guilty later this week.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            At the same time, the prosecutor, Carolyn Murray, an assistant
                         U.S. attorney in New Jersey, said that the 23 Chinese immigrants
                         who arrived aboard that smuggling ship and have since been detained
                         by the authorities as witnesses in the federal investigation would
                         probably be released on bond soon. Beginning next week, the federal
                         government plans to take depositions from some of the 23 in a
                         process that should take several weeks, and at its conclusion, will
                         allow the immigrants to be released.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``The whole purpose of the depositions is to keep the amount of
                         time they spend in custody as witnesses to a minimum,'' Ms. Murray
                         said after a calendar conference with defense lawyers before Judge
                         Dickinson Debevoise in U.S. District Court here. So far, the
                         illegal immigrants have been detained for more than two months.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Tuesday's proceeding was not a formal hearing; it was more a
                         matter of legal necessity to coordinate schedules and logistics as
                         the summer winds down. Even so, the conference hinted at how the
                         government is proceeding with its investigation into the smuggling
                         of illegal immigrants, and what lies ahead for the principal
                         players involved.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The federal government is investigating the events surrounding
                         the evening of May 30, when a power boat carrying the illegal
                         immigrants ran aground in a soupy fog in the affluent town of Bay
                         Head, N.J., some eight miles north of the intended destination,
                         Belmar, N.J.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The case attracted additional attention, no doubt, because of
                         its parallels with the case of Golden Venture, a larger ship that
                         was carrying 286 illegal Chinese immigrants when it sputtered to a
                         halt in Queens in 1993. There was cruel coincidence, too: The name
                         of the powerboat in this case was the Oops II.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Last month, the federal government indicted six men in a
                         conspiracy to smuggle the 23 Chinese men into the United States.
                         The six were accused of participating in an international smuggling
                         operation that solicited as much as $40,000 apiece from anyone
                         interested in being taken from Fujian province in southern China
                         via South America to the United States.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Five of the six are being held without bail in New Jersey jails;
                         the other, Charng Seon Choi, is still at large. One man facing
                         smuggling charges, Kim Jong Che, has said that he was born in Korea
                         but lives in Venezuela, while the backgrounds and residences of the
                         other defendants remain unclear.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But last week, another of the six, Cho Yang Nam, pleaded guilty
                         to one conspiracy charge, acknowledging that he plotted with
                         unnamed others to smuggle the Chinese immigrants, according to
                         court documents. He has since agreed to cooperate with
                         investigators, which could pare his sentence from its maximum of 10
                         years in jail and a $250,000 fine, the documents show.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Cho's guilty plea was not disclosed until Tuesday, however,
                         because of case strategy, Ms. Murray said. Another man accused of
                         smuggling, Nam Jick Cho of Bayside, Queens, may plead guilty this
                         week, she said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Neither of the Chos _ who prosecutors say are not believed to be
                         related _ appeared in court Tuesday. But the other three accused
                         men in custody _ Che, Piao Zhen Jia and Jiang Yong Zhu _ did show
                         up in the courtroom, looking stone-faced while listening to a
                         translator. The trial is scheduled to being on Nov. 17.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            As for the illegal immigrants, they were first held in an
                         Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center in
                         Elizabeth, N.J. Most were released in mid-July on bond by two
                         immigration judges, only to be immediately rearrested by federal
                         authorities as witnesses in the federal investigation.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            For now, the 23 men remain in government custody, most in the
                         Passaic County Jail. But some of the men briefly escaped the
                         loneliness of being imprisoned in a foreign land when they were
                         reunited last month with several relatives who appeared in
                         immigration court in Elizabeth to offer testimony to support the
                         men's release on bond.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Now, the prospect of reunions lasting more than a few minutes,
                         and occurring outside of a courtroom, looms larger. Within a week
                         or so, federal prosecutors are expected to whittle the list of 23
                         to about 10 or so men from whom they plan to take videotaped
                         depositions.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Those who are not deposed presumably will be released
                         immediately; those who are formally questioned will be released
                         after their depositions, assuming no further legal complications,
                         Ms. Murray said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Of course, the men still face deportation hearings by the INS.
                         But most have filed for political asylum.
                         </P>
