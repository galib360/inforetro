                    <h2> CONFESSED SMUGGLER OF CHINESE GIVES ACCOUNT OF ENTERPRISE  </h2>
                    <P>
                            Providing the fullest account to date of an operation to smuggle
                         Chinese immigrants into the United States, a top organizer said
                         Wednesday that the smugglers transported at least 100 people on as
                         many as five voyages from South America over a year and a half,
                         before bungling the latest trip in May off the coast of New Jersey.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The smuggler, Nam Jick Cho, 57, was so committed to the
                         enterprise that he said he often flew to Venezuela and Suriname
                         from his home in Queens to insure that the Chinese were squeezed
                         aboard the smuggling ship, the Oriental I. When the ship had
                         mechanical trouble in Bermuda en route to New Jersey, Cho flew down
                         carrying new parts. And to prepare for the arrival of the latest
                         group of immigrants in Belmar, N.J., he paid $7,000 for a van to
                         take the men to a parking lot in Flushing.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Cho offered these details and more Wednesday in U.S. District
                         Court in Newark, N.J., during a remarkably candid hearing in which
                         he pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges in connection with
                         the operation, which came to light when the Oops II, a smaller boat
                         that had picked up the men from the Oriental I, ran aground in New
                         Jersey.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Cho is the second man involved in the Oriental I operation to
                         plead guilty to conspiracy charges in the last week. Three other
                         men, all crew members aboard the Oriental I, remain in government
                         custody, while a fourth _ a Queens resident named Charng Seon Choi,
                         said to be another top organizer _ remains at large.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Before Wednesday's hearing, some details had emerged about the
                         Oriental I and the 23 Chinese it unloaded in New Jersey, mainly
                         from a federal complaint, and from the Chinese themselves. But Cho
                         is the first person on the operations side of the endeavor to
                         discuss what happened and what, ultimately, went wrong in New
                         Jersey.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``Among the people we have, he is an important one,'' said
                         Carolyn Murray, an assistant U.S. attorney. ``He was in charge of
                         land operations, so to speak. He hired some of the others.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Speaking through a Korean interpreter, Cho said that he had been
                         hired by Choi to participate in a smuggling operation that
                         solicited $25,000 to $40,000 apiece from anyone interested in
                         leaving Fujian Province in southern China for North America.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In general, the scheme worked like this: First, the smugglers
                         took the immigrants to Suriname by air or by ship. A man with the
                         surname Chang, based in South America, arranged housing for the
                         immigrants. Cho secured the use of the Oriental I, a 120-foot
                         fishing vessel owned by a Venezuelan company, to smuggle the
                         immigrants. Then the smugglers directed the Chinese onto a small
                         boat that, in turn, reconnoitered with the Oriental I about 30
                         miles off the Suriname coast.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Each trip would include 20 or so immigrants, Cho said. And Cho
                         would receive a cut of $7,000 from the smuggling fee paid by each
                         immigrant.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In all, the Oriental I made four or five trips to North America
                         between March 1997 and June 1998, Cho said, including two to the
                         Bahamas and two to the United States.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            It was not clear when or where the Oriental I made its first
                         trip to the United States; Cho did not say. But Cho has also been
                         indicted on similar charges in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
                         Ms. Murray said. In many cases, the final destination of the
                         immigrants is Chinatown or Flushing, Queens, where jobs for Chinese
                         are more plentiful.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But the most recent trip of the Oriental I was a little
                         different.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I got the impression that this trip was more unusual because
                         it came into New Jersey, and not somewhere in the city,'' said Sean
                         McGovern, Cho's lawyer. ``They had presumed that it would be safer
                         to go into New Jersey, with less chance of being detected by the
                         authorities.''
                         </P>
                         <ANNOTATION>
                            (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
                         </ANNOTATION>
                         <P>
                            According to Cho, the Oriental I carried an unusually large load
                         of 50 Chinese immigrants, with scheduled drop-offs in Belmar, N.J.,
                         and the Bahamas. In addition, the ship broke down in Bermuda,
                         requiring Cho to fly down with new equipment.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            At some point, the other smugglers gave Cho $35,000 to pay for
                         the van _ on which the imprint of the previous owner, a Korean
                         church, was still visible _ and other expenses in New Jersey.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            On May 29, he traveled to Point Pleasant, N.J., to test out a
                         small powerboat, the Oops II, in anticipation of picking up the
                         immigrants. On May 30, Choi steered the Oops II to meet the
                         Oriental I, about 100 miles offshore, while Cho waited in Belmar
                         with the van.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            There was dense fog, though, and after picking up the men the
                         Oops II ended up in the affluent town of Bay Head, eight miles off
                         target to the south. But McGovern said that Cho told him that he
                         simply ran out of gas and drifted toward shore before dropping the
                         23 off against a backdrop of mansions.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The Oriental I, meanwhile, chugged on to the Bahamas, dropping
                         off 20 or so more Chinese before experiencing mechanical
                         difficulties _ again. And on June 8, the U.S. Coast Guard found the
                         Oriental I about 195 miles east of San Salvador Island in the
                         Bahamas.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Wednesday, Cho said that he felt remorse over his role in the
                         operation, McGovern said. In exchange for his cooperation,
                         investigators could pare his sentence from its of maximum of 10
                         years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Last week, Cho Yang Nam, a deckman aboard the Oriental I,
                         pleaded guilty to one conspiracy charge; he, too, is cooperating
                         with authorities. Three others _ Kim Jong Che, the captain; Piao
                         Zhen Jia, a cook, and Jiang Yong Zhu, a mechanic _ are expected to
                         go to trial on Nov. 17, their lawyers have said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            As for the 23 Chinese from the Oops II, they remain in
                         government custody. The government expects to begin taking
                         videotaped depositions of some of the 23 men beginning Monday, Ms.
                         Murray said, meaning that the men should be released on bond soon.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But that freedom could be brief. All still face deportation
                         proceedings by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
                         </P>
