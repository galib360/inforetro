                    <P>
                            An international smuggling ring involving 300 rare and
                         endangered animals _ including giant Komodo dragons and other
                         exotic creatures _ has been broken up with arrests in Arizona, San
                         Francisco and Mexico City.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The arrests and animal confiscations resulted from an undercover
                         investigation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spanning more
                         than five years.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Among those animals recovered Monday in the Phoenix area were
                         five white-lipped water monitors from Malaysia and a star tortoise
                         from India, according to agents of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
                         Those animals were discovered after a search warrant was served at
                         a home in the 2200 block of West Keating Avenue in Mesa. The owner
                         of that house was not accused of any wrongdoing.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Among those arrested late Monday was Beau Lee Lewis, 20, who
                         federal authorities allege ran an illegal reptile trade out of his
                         parent's home in the 13400 block of South Watermann Lane in
                         Buckeye.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Lewis was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Phoenix before
                         Magistrate Morton Sitver, who ordered Lewis released to the custody
                         of his parents and ordered not to leave his parents home until
                         further court hearings take place in U.S. District Court in San
                         Francisco.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Lewis could not be reached for comment.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Federal officials identified him as the owner of Beau Lewis Rare
                         Reptiles, formerly Southwest Reptile Exchange, through which he
                         reportedly sold rare animals illegally to customers throughout the
                         U.S.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Also arrested late Monday were James Michael Burroughs, 47, of
                         San Francisco, and Keng Liang ``Anson'' Wong, 40, of Penang,
                         Malaysia, who was taken into custody in Mexico City. Authorities
                         are looking for a fourth suspect, Yuk Wah ``Oscar'' Shiu, 39, in
                         Hong Kong.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Wong is believed to be the kingpin of an international smuggling
                         operation that plundered reptiles from southeast and central Asia,
                         New Zealand and Madagascar for sale in the U.S. and other markets,
                         according to a report by the Fish and Wildlife Service.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Federal authorities said Burroughs worked as a courier for Wong.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The three were named in a 55-count federal indictment unsealed
                         Tuesday that alleges smuggling, money laundering, conspiracy, false
                         statement and violating wildlife laws, including the U.S.
                         Endangered Species Act. They face penalties of up to 20 years in
                         prison and fines of as much as $500,000 if convicted.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The indictment alleges that between January 1996 and Aug. 15,
                         the defendants illegally smuggled more than 300 animals worth
                         nearly $500,000 into the U.S.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The animals were transported via human couriers, Federal Express
                         shipments with false invoices and shipping documents, and concealed
                         within larger shipments of legal animals, the indictment says.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The internationally protected animals were smuggled from
                         Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines to the U.S.,
                         according to the indictment.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The smuggling of extremely rare animals, some found only in
                         extremely limited habitats and near extinction, was denounced by
                         Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
                         </P>

                         the demand for reptiles prized as exotic live collectibles will not
                         be tolerated by this country or by our global conservation
                         partners,'' Clark said.

                            Among the animals illegally traded for upwards of $30,000 each,
                         were:

                            Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard, which grows up to 10
                         feet long and is found only on Komodo Island and a few neighboring
                         islands in Indonesia.

                         surviving member of the taxonomic order ``Sphenodon punctatus.''
                         All the rest of the members of this animal group died off with the
                         dinosaurs more than 60 million years ago. It is found on 30 small
                         islands off the coast of New Zealand.
