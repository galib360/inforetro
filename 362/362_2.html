                    <h2> Police fear Chinese underworld gangs thriving in Japan </h2>

<P>
        TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese gangs are a growing threat in Japan,
        smuggling illegal workers into Japan and carrying out auto theft,
        credit-card fraud, muggings and other crimes, police say.
</P>
<P>
        Concern over the presence of Chinese underworld gangs has been
        heightened by a string of recent arrests.
</P>
<P>
        In one, a 40-year-old Chinese man arrested in late June on
        charges of violating immigration laws is a suspected leader of the
        ``Shanghai mafia,'' based in Tokyo's seedy Kabukicho area, the
        Yomiuri newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
        The Shanghai mafia is divided into smaller groups, each
specializing in a criminal activity, including thefts, kidnappings
and passport forgery, the report said.
</P>
<P>
        One such group tampered with machines for pachinko, or Japanese
pinball, so players could win more money, it said.
</P>
<P>
        Police refused to comment on that report, but acknowledge they
have reason to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
        Crimes by foreigners in Japan have climbed nearly fivefold in
the last five years, from 4,277 in 1992 to 19,128 last year,
according to a recent report by the National Police Agency.
</P>
<P>
        The report, called ``The Quiet Invasion of International
Organized Crime,'' said Chinese gangs are suspected of engineering
much of the smuggling of those seeking better-paying jobs, running
the operation as a lucrative and relatively safe business.
</P>
<P>
        It said they charge about 4 million yen (dlrs 28,000) a head.
	   Last week, the Japanese Coast Guard found 98 suspected illegal
immigrants, all believed to be Chinese, hidden in a sweltering
container on board a freighter from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
        Reports of such stowaways have grown increasingly common.
	   Osamu Ishida, a Tsukuba Women's University professor who has
written books about the Chinese mafia in Japan, says their
influence is swelling.
</P>
<P>
        ``This is not something that's happening far, far away. It's
        going on right next-door in our neighborhoods,'' he said in a
        telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
        Ishida estimated the number of Chinese gangs living and working
in Japan in the thousands, perhaps totaling 10,000 or 20,000.
</P>
<P>
        ``The Chinese gangs see Japan as the final uncultivated mass
market, after the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe,'' he
said.
