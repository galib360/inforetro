                    <P>
                            WASHINGTON _ Federal officials said Friday they have broken a
                         major international cartel that smuggled illegal workers from India
                         and other countries into the United States through Texas and
                         Florida.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            So far, 21 people, including one from Houston, have been
                         arrested for participating in the three affiliated rings
                         responsible for smuggling as many as 12,000 illegal immigrants to
                         this country during the past three years.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Thirty-one people have been indicted by a federal grand jury in
                         Dallas, where immigration officials first began investigating the
                         case about a year ago. The indictments contain 58
                         immigration-related and money laundering counts.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``It is time for those who traffic in flesh to pay their pound
                         of flesh,'' said Paul Coggins, U.S. attorney for the Northern
                         District of Texas in Dallas.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The three, loosely connected rings specialized in providing
                         foreign labor to employers in the United States, charging as much
                         as $20,000 per person to transport immigrants to this country.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            While most of the workers were from India, the organizations
                         also smuggled immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Coggins appeared Friday with Attorney General Janet Reno and
                         Doris Meissner, director of the Immigration and Naturalization
                         Service, who lauded government agents for cracking what they
                         described as the biggest and most sophisticated smuggling scheme
                         ever dismantled by U.S. officials.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``Let all those who flout the nation's immigration laws be
                         warned: We plan to take swift action against you,'' said Reno.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The attorney general criticized ``unscrupulous employers ... who
                         want cheap labor and fearful workers who could easily be
                         manipulated.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The rings transported the workers to the United States by a
                         circuitous route that involved travel across four continents.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The workers would travel by air from India to Moscow and then be
                         flown to Cuba, where they would be taken to the Bahamas, Ecuador or
                         other South American countries.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            From those transit points the immigrants would be smuggled into
                         Miami, by boat or plane, or through Central America into Texas,
                         where many ended up in Dallas.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Officials said immigrants would be flown by planes to private
                         airstrips near McAllen, or be smuggled on the ground across the
                         Texas border.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            From Dallas most would be sent to East Coast cities, where they
                         often ended up in what officials called ``stash houses'' where they
                         were prohibited from leaving until either the employers or the
                         immigrants paid the cartels the large fees.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Officials said that cartels sometimes demanded fees along the
                         route at various stops, such as in the Bahamas, where the
                         immigrants were detained in houses. The trip could often last for
                         months or years. Most of those being smuggled into the country were
                         adult males, they said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Officials said the top person involved in the smuggling
                         operations was a man known as Nick Diaz, who was indicted on Nov.
                         14 in the Bahamas. Diaz, also known as Nitin Shettie, is in custody
                         in Miami.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            A second ring leader ,Navtej Pall Singh Sandu, was arrested in
                         Puerto Rico. A third, Niranjan Maan Singh, is being sought and is
                         believed to be in India.

                            Among those arrested Nov. 19 was a man known as Nizar Lnu of
                         Houston. According to court papers Nizar traveled to Bedford, a
                         suburb of Dallas, on Sept. 15 and discussed transporting an
                         immigrant, Mahmad Maredia Zulfikar, to Houston. Nizar paid $5,000
                         as a partial payment for smuggling fees, according to court
                         documents .

                         <P>
                            Others arrested in Texas were Hiren Jashvant Bhai Pat in Dumas
                         on Nov. 16 and Dinesh Patel in Fort Worth on the same date.

                         <P>
                            Federal officials said that so far they have concentrated on
                         nabbing the ring leaders in the international smuggling groups and
                         have not indicted any of the businesses who hired them.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Officials declined to say what kind of businesses were involved
                         in the scheme, saying that to do so might compromise the ongoing
                         investigation.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Immigration officials have been interviewing many of the
                         immigrants in hope of using their testimony in court proceedings.
                         However, they have not yet determined whether the immigrants should
                         be deported.
