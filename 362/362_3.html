                    <h2> Eight people found dead in container on ship </h2>
                    <P>
                            TOKYO (AP) _ Eight people were found dead Monday in a cargo
                            container aboard a freighter that arrived in a Tokyo port from
                            China, the coast guard said.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                            Officials believe the eight _ seven women and one man _ died of
                            dehydration and that they were Chinese who had been trying to enter
                            Japan illegally, said Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Takeshi
                            Noda.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                            They were discovered aboard the St. Vincent and the
                            Grenadines-registered Goldrich River, which left the Chinese port
                            of Dalian last week and arrived in Tokyo's Ohi pier Monday with a
                            cargo of artificial flowers. </P>
                    <P>
                            Eight others found in the container were suffering from severe
                            dehydration and taken to a hospital. Their condition was not
                            immediately known, Noda said.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                            He said police searched the ship after coast guards were
                            informed stowaways may be aboard the ship.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                            The Goldrich River is owned by Goldrich Shipping Ltd. of Hong
                            Kong and operated by Japan's Kawasaki Kisen.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                            Last year, police arrested 7,117 foreigners, including 3,045
                            Chinese for trying to enter Japan illegally, nearly a fifty percent
                            rise from 1996, according to the immigration office.
                    </P>
