                    <P>
                            WASHINGTON _ Federal agents crushed an international operation
                         that smuggled 12,000 illegal immigrants into the United States over
                         three years for employers who had placed orders for workers,
                         Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The undocumented workers from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and
                         Syria paid as much as $28,000 and were routed through Dallas, which
                         served as a transshipment point inside the United States, Reno
                         said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``This is the largest alien smuggling organization every
                         dismantled in United States history,'' she said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Twenty-one people indicted in the smuggling ring are in custody
                         and 10 others are being sought, the authorities said. Attention is
                         now being turned on the employers who hired the illegal workers.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
                         Naturalization Service, said the ring, made up of three ``flesh
                         cartels'' based in India, reaped as much as $60 million each year
                         ``trafficking in human cargo.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The immigrants were smuggled through Moscow, Cuba and the
                         Ecuadorean capital of Quito where they received false documents and
                         forged passports that allowed them to enter the United States
                         through Houston, Miami and McAllen, Texas.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Once inside the country, the immigrants were shipped to Dallas,
                         where they were parceled out to hundreds of employers in Boston,
                         Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York and other points, said
                         U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins of Dallas.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            INS officials said most of the illegal laborers worked in 38
                         states, mainly in the East and the central states. INS spokesman
                         Russ Bergeron declined to identify the 38 states on the basis that
                         the investigation was still under way.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Coggins released three unsealed indictments Friday charging 31
                         people with the organized plot to smuggle the foreigners. He said
                         21 of those charged were in custody.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Two suspected ringleaders _ Nitin Shettie, 30, and Navtej Pall
                         Singh Sandhu, 40, both of India _ were in custody in the Bahamas
                         and London, respectively. A third suspect, Niranjan Maan Singh, 58,
                         is believed to be in hiding in India.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Coggins said INS inspectors and FBI agents were targeting
                         employers who hired the illegal workers and ``businesses that
                         placed orders'' for the undocumented laborers.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Most of the immigrants were employed in the service sector,
                         working in restaurants and other businesses that catered goods and
                         services to consumers.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            More than 25 work sites have been investigated by federal agents
                         and Coggins said the Justice Department was working on hundreds of
                         leads in the next phase of the investigation, called Operation Seek
                         and Keep.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The investigation was aided, federal officials said, by a 1996
                         immigration law that gave the INS authority to use wiretaps in
                         smuggling investigations. And federal money-laundering laws gave
                         investigators the ability to seize homes used as ``stash houses''
                         where immigrants were held until smuggling fees were paid in full.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``The INS is using the legal tools given to it by the 1996
                         immigration and reform law and should be applauded for stopping
                         organized alien smuggling,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the
                         House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and author of the bill.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``The joint law enforcement operation marks a turning point in a
                         battle against alien smugglers,'' said Smith, R-Texas.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Meissner said the three cartels often overlapped and worked in
                         together to smuggle more than 300 workers to U.S. employers each
                         month.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Coggins said the investigation was launched a year ago when
                         Dallas INS officers caught a group of undocumented workers, and
                         began a follow-up probe that revealed the ring's operations
                         extended into other cities.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The year-long investigation turned up evidence the ring had
                         operated for at least three years. They recruited immigrants,
                         shipped them by airplane and boat to other foreign locations.
                         Clandestine centers produced the false documents that allowed the
                         immigrants to enter the United States, usually at airports and
                         airstrips.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            According to the indictments, Shettie and his associates,
                         working in the Bahamas and India, would arrange for the smuggling
                         of immigrants into the United States for a fee ranging from $20,000
                         to $28,000.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Shettie then moved immigrants through foreign countries and into
                         U.S. stash houses.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Shettie was arrested Nov. 14 in the Bahamas. Charges of
                         transporting and smuggling undocumented workers carry a prison
                         sentence of up to 10 years and as much as $250,000 in fines.
