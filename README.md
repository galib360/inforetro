Project for Information Retrieval

Proposed Solution: Our team believes that there is an opportunity to reproduce the paper *Mouse Movement During Relevance Judging: Implications for Determining User Attention*. With this in mind, our project goals are:

Goals
- To establish a prototype that records mouse tracking from the user to other formats to better connect existing user behavior to document classification.
- To create a scalable solution that handles multiple users simultaneously completing the experiment that perform in different environments.
- To monitor system performance and perform experiments on mouse movement to show how mouse position can be used for determining user attention.


Our solution includes two parts: (i) A front-end web application that allows users to classify documents and (ii) a back-end application that records mouse movement and is responsible for saving mouse positions for evaluation.
