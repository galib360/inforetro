                              HAVANA (AP) -- About 100,000 chanting, flag-waving government supporters
                           massed today in front of the U.S. mission, venting anger at a U.N. human rights
                           censure and at delays in the return of Elian Gonzalez. The enormous crowd,
                           called to the protest by the government, spilled out along Havana's waterfront,
                           from a newly erected protest stage outside the U.S. Interests Section. President
                           Clinton said today that the boy should be promptly reunited with his father, now
                           that a federal court has ruled that Elian must stay in the United States until
                           the court decides whether he should get an asylum hearing. A hearing was set for
                           May 11.

                              DOKCHON, South Korea (AP) -- According to declassified U.S. military
                           documents and witnesses, South Korean soldiers and police, observed at times by
                           U.S. Army officers, executed more than 2,000 political prisoners without trial
                           in the early weeks of the Korean War. Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur
                           became aware of at least one of the mass shootings, according to documents
                           originally classified ''top secret.'' The new information, detailed in reporting
                           by The Associated Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some
                           historians have long believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists arrested
                           by the right-wing regime were secretly killed.

                           times in memory of the first anniversary of the nation's deadliest school
                           shooting. The bell tolled 13 times at 11:21 a.m. today, the precise moment two
                           teen-agers opened fire in Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. At private
                           ceremonies and public remembrances all day and into the night today, students,
                           staff, survivors and strangers came together to mark the moment that Dylan
                           Klebold and Eric Harris began the bloodbath, killing 12 students and a teacher
                           and wounding 26 before taking their own lives.

                              MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Six former Mexico City policemen convicted of the robbery
                           and murder by alcohol poisoning of an American student have been sentenced to up
                           to 98 years in prison. Frederick McPhail, 27, was found in his parked car
                           Chapultepec Park in Mexico City in November 1998. For their roles in the death,
                           Francisco Leon Gonzalez received 99 years in prison and Lucio Tapia Galindo
                           received 85 years, the daily newspaper Reforma reported Thursday. The two were
                           active police officers at the time of the crime. Three accomplices received
                           sentences of 79 years, while a fourth received 68 years, Reforma said.

                              ATLANTA (AP) -- The vast majority of overweight adults trying to shed pounds
                           aren't getting enough exercise, the government said today. A 1998 national
                           survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 53.8 percent
                           of American adults reported being overweight and that half of them were trying
                           to lose weight. Most of those trying to lose weight -- 62.7 percent -- were
                           exercising, but only 28 percent said they exercised 30 minutes a day at least
                           five days a week, the minimum government recommendation.
