                    <h2> 6 KILLED BY TRAIN WHILE SLEEPING ON TRACKS </h2>
                    <P>
                            HOUSTON _ Six people believed to be illegal immigrants from
                         Mexico were hit and killed early Monday by a freight train as they
                         slept on a desolate stretch of tracks in southern Texas. Officials
                         said they believed the immigrants may have been victims of a
                         superstition that the rails would keep them safe from snakes.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``There's a myth that if you sleep between the rails that snakes
                         will not get you,'' said Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific.
                         ``You go down the railroad tracks, you'll see snakes cut in half.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Davis said the driver of the train blew the whistle repeatedly
                         when he noticed the people on the tracks. Although a couple of the
                         victims raised their heads, no one got off the tracks. Davis said
                         he was uncertain how far the train was from the victims when the
                         driver saw them. But, he added, it would have taken a mile to stop
                         the 105-car train, which was traveling between 45 and 49 miles an
                         hour.

                            The vast ranchlands of South Texas that stretch between the Rio
                         Grande and San Antonio are among the most remote in the state, mile
                         after mile of mesquite, prickly pear, citrus farms and grazing
                         lands that are a prime avenue for illegal immigrants trying to make
                         their way from the Mexican border to San Antonio or Houston.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            While illegal immigrants have been killed while sleeping on
                         railroad tracks before, Fred Borrego, patrol agent in charge of the
                         U.S. Border Patrol in Kingsville, said never had so many been
                         killed in one accident. Between 2,000 and 3,000 illegal immigrants
                         pass through his 2,600-square-mile patrol area each month, he said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The most recent victims, who were badly mutilated, have not been
                         identified. They were taken to Corpus Christi where authorities
                         will try to use fingerprints to determine their identity.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Borrego had another possible explanation for the accident.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``Another theory I've been told is that in Mexico the trains
                         don't run at night,'' Borrego said. ``They say they sleep up there
                         because they feel a lot safer.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Although it seems implausible that people could sleep with the
                         noise of a train running toward them, Davis said, ``a train
                         operating when you're in front of it is very, very quiet.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The engine noise is primarily to the side, he said, and there is
                         very little friction on the rail itself.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I know its hard to believe,'' Borrego said. ``I've experienced
                         this myself. If it's coming toward you it's as quiet as a cat.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But officials in the Kenedy County sheriff's office speculated
                         that the hard traveling conditions confronted by the immigrants
                         could also have played a role. The terrain in the area is very
                         rugged, with most of it being brush covered.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``You think, `I'd never fall asleep there' or `Why wouldn't they
                         wake up?''' said Hopy Alines, a secretary in the sheriff's office.
                         ``But it just doesn't happen. These people travel three, four and
                         five days without eating, without sleeping. They're just completely
                         exhausted and they don't wake up.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Generally the illegal immigrants traveling through the county go
                         unnoticed aside from the trail of odds and ends they leave behind,
                         Ms. Alise said. ``You'll see empty bottles, sometimes bags of
                         clothes,'' she said. ``We get a lot of calls where they break in
                         and all they ever take is food and water.'' It is generally when
                         people get sick or have problems that officials hear stories like
                         the ones about people sleeping on the tracks.
