                    <h2> Widespread Rail Track Defects Found </h2>
                    <P>
                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- CSX Transportation announced an internal
                         review of its track maintenance Friday after federal railroad
                         inspectors found deteriorating conditions in its system used by
                         passenger, freight and commuter trains up and down the East Coast.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The Federal Railroad Administration had begun a special safety
                         audit of the railroad in February after a series of derailments.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            George Gavalla, associate administrator for safety, said the
                         agency audited CSX in 1997 and became concerned because it hadn't
                         seen a reduction in derailments and other problems.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            John W. Snow, chairman and chief executive officer of CSX
                         Corporation, responded that his company ''has repaired or is in the
                         process of repairing all of the defects identified in the report.
                         Where work is in progress, operations have been modified to ensure
                         safe movement of trains.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The company said Snow will personally head an internal company
                         review of all track maintenance and improvement programs.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ''The main concern,'' Gavalla said in a telephone interview,
                         ''was the lack of quality control in CSX track inspection
                         maintenance programs.'' He said the railroad has promised to
                         initiate safety programs that go beyond federal standards.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Problems were found in track conditions used by Amtrak and
                         commuter rail lines and in one case insufficient repairs were made
                         following a derailment, Gavalla said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The audit found a 60 percent increase in track-caused accidents
                         over five years on the 22,700-mile system, according to a report in
                         The Washington Post.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The review found many instances in which the distance between
                         the rails had spread wide enough to risk derailments.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Two such wide areas were found in the District of Columbia on
                         the line used by Amtrak, Virginia Railway Express and all
                         north-south CSX freight trains. The defects were repaired
                         immediately after they were found.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Defects were also found in Florida, Pennsylvania and Maryland
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Two of three recent track-caused derailments were caused by wide
                         track, including a minor derailment of Amtrak's Chicago-Washington
                         Capitol Limited at Connellsville, Pa., on Jan. 30.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Federal safety standards dictate conditions for railroad track
                         including the gauge, or distance between tracks. Railroads are
                         supposed to inspect their tracks twice a week and, when a problem
                         is found, either make immediate repairs or slow traffic over the
                         area until it can be fixed.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The special safety audit is not a rare event, Gavalla said. ''We
                         always have inspectors on every railroad virtually every day.''
                         </P>
