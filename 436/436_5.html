                    <h2> THOUSANDS ARE DELAYED AS CONRAIL FREIGHT TRAIN DERAILS </h2>
                    <P>
                            NEW YORK _ A double-decker car on a Conrail freight train
                         slammed into a railway overpass in the Bronx early Friday, causing
                         a derailment that severely disrupted service on the Hudson line of
                         the Metro-North commuter railway for much of the day and left
                         thousands of commuters scrambling to get to work.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Conrail officials acknowledged that the freight train should not
                         have been loaded with a double-decker car on that rail line, and
                         the accident underscored how any disruption on the heavily
                         overburdened rail lines can affect the whole system.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Although no one was injured in the accident, which involved a
                         125-car Conrail freight train traveling into New York City from
                         Albany, it hobbled train service not only on the Hudson line but
                         also on the Harlem and New Haven lines, whose tracks were
                         temporarily closed because of the derailment.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I couldn't get to work at the usual time,'' said Nadine C.
                         Johnson, a Manhattan lawyer who lives in Ossining, N.Y., and was
                         forced with hundreds of other riders on the Hudson line to get off
                         her train in the Bronx and transfer for a long subway ride into
                         midtown.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I considered not going at all,'' she said. And after being
                         ``really rattled'' by a radio report that commuters might find no
                         service when they wanted to return home from Manhattan, she said
                         she was relieved to find that delays were the worst she would face
                         in her commute.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Long delays continued into the evening for passengers on the
                         Hudson line, which the freight train was using when it derailed,
                         scattering twisted pieces of metal and other debris on the sidings
                         near River Avenue and 153rd Street.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said service on all its
                         lines would resume normal weekend schedules Saturday, and was
                         expected to be running normally for weekday commuters on Monday.
                         </P>
                         <ANNOTATION>
                            (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
                         </ANNOTATION>
                         <P>
                            The delays Friday angered and frustrated riders from Stamford,
                         Conn., to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., but also gave many an excuse to
                         extend their weekend, or at least prepare for it.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``It actually helped me,'' said Elizabeth Nolan of Tarrytown,
                         N.Y., who works as an administrator at a Manhattan clothing
                         company, and who said she heard of the derailment on the radio at
                         5:30 a.m.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            She seized upon the opportunity to postpone her early morning
                         commute, and stayed at home long enough to bake cookies and run
                         errands before boarding a train that deposited her at the Marble
                         Hill station, where she then transferred to a subway, at 9:30 a.m.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I can leave Westchester with a clear mind,'' she said with a
                         laugh.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Far less sanguine, however, were senior officials of Conrail,
                         Metro-North and the New York state Department of Transportation,
                         for whom the accident provided a glaring example of the dangers
                         inherent in an overburdened rail system.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Ms. Anders said several government agencies, including the
                         National Transportation Safety Board, were investigating the cause
                         of the accident. ``This is a case where some poor soul simply put a
                         car on that train that was too big to get under the overpass,'' she
                         said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Responsibility for the freight train and the configuration of
                         its cars rests with Conrail, which for decades has used portions of
                         the track owned by Metro-North to haul freight on long trains that
                         make their way in and out of the city, mainly to Albany and
                         elsewhere in the country in the hours before dawn, when the tracks
                         would otherwise be idle.
