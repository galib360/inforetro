                    <h2> New S.F. Cable Car Introduced  </h2>
                    <P>
                            SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- They just don't make cable cars like they
                         used to -- except, of course, in San Francisco.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Working from dog-eared blueprints and plans kept only in their
                         heads, four carpenters spent 3,000 hours making a brand-new cable
                         car that's set to hit the rails Monday.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The new, green and white No. 9 car was crafted by hand, from its
                         bronze-alloy bell to its Alaskan cedar roof. It will carry its
                         first passengers exactly 100 years after the death of the father of
                         cable cars, Andrew Hallidie.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            One hundred also is the car's life expectancy because the San
                         Francisco cable cars are so solid, made almost entirely of oak, and
                         are so painstakingly maintained.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ''I think the number one reason they last longer than street
                         cars is that they're hand made,'' says 45-year-old Bob Harris, a
                         carpenter who has crafted cable cars for 22 years. ''There's
                         special care in everything. Plus, they have no motor parts to wear
                         out.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            San Francisco's first cable cars started wearing out in the
                         1980s, and the Municipal Railway workshop has been crafting new
                         ones just about every other year.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            According to the San Francisco Cable Car museum, Hallidie
                         hatched upon the innovative idea of making street cars that grab
                         constantly moving underground cables for power after seeing a
                         horse-drawn streetcar accident in 1869 in which five horses were
                         killed.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In the following years, cable car systems bloomed in cities all
                         over the world, only to be eclipsed in the 1940s by electrical
                         street cars, subways and buses. While San Francisco's routes shrank
                         to just two -- crisscrossing the hilly city on the California and
                         Powell lines -- the cable car and its clanging bell has become a
                         city landmark.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Locals tend to shy away from the cable cars since the admission
                         price is double that of buses, but tourists line up by the hundreds
                         for the thrill of hanging perilously off a lurching, old-fashioned
                         machine.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            According to legend, the original blueprints were destroyed in
                         the fires that followed the 1906 earthquake, and since then
                         craftsmen have been drawing up patterns on the fly and passing the
                         craft down through the generations.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ''We have bits and pieces of plans, but a lot of it is just in
                         the carpenters' heads,'' says Harris. ''It's like putting a puzzle
                         back together. That's what I really like about working here, it's
                         such a challenge.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Each 7-ton car costs about $275,000. Constant maintenance is
                         needed to replace the wooden brake shoes and grips that grab the
                         underground cable, which moves at a constant speed of 9 mph. Both
                         the shoes and grips are crafted at the Municipal Railway workshop
                         and must be replaced every three days.
