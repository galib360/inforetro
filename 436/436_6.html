                    <h2> 6 KILLED BY TRAIN WHILE SLEEPING ON TRACKS  </h2>
                    <P>
                            The train, which was carrying a variety of freight like scrap
                         paper and metal automobile parts, was traveling from Houston to
                         Brownsville, Texas, when the accident occurred about 3:15 a.m. near
                         the tiny town of Norias, which is 60 miles north of Brownsville.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Last year in Texas there were 38 fatalities and 80 injuries
                         involving what railroad officials call ``trespass accidents,''
                         Davis said, cases where people were struck on or near tracks or
                         trying to get on a railroad car.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Borrego said the last time he could remember a large group of
                         illegal immigrants being killed on train tracks was in 1983 or 1984
                         when 14 people were killed trying to cross a railroad trestle.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Border Patrol officials along with Union Pacific officials
                         caution illegal immigrants about sleeping on railroad tracks as
                         part of general information they provide on the dangers of crossing
                         the border.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``Sometimes they don't get the word,'' Borrego said. ``The
                         conditions out here are rigid. You've got cactus, mesquite. It's no
                         fun walking through the territory. They run out of water, they get
                         bit by snakes.''
                         </P>
