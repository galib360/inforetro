                            It is one of most common gun accidents: A person picks up a
                         semiautomatic pistol, takes out the magazine containing the
                         cartridges and, thinking the weapon is empty, squeezes the trigger
                         and shoots himself or someone else.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            When a semiautomatic's magazine is removed, a round can remain
                         in the chamber, ready to be fired, and scores of people, from
                         adults cleaning guns to children playing with them, have died or
                         been seriously hurt in recent years as a result.
                         </P>

                            Gun producers have long known of the danger, and some have
                         responded by building into their guns an inexpensive mechanism
                         known as a magazine safety. But the fact that many gun makers have
                         chosen not to use simple devices like magazine safeties and gun
                         locks is now a focus of a growing wave of lawsuits in which cities
                         are accusing the firearms industry of making guns needlessly
                         dangerous.

                            A look at how gun makers have chosen to use, or not use, the
                         magazine safety provides a glimpse into an industry driven by
                         unique marketing forces. In the absence of government safety
                         regulation, different companies set their own standards, and
                         producers have not sought independent answers about safety issues
                         or been able to reach internal consensus on them.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            For decades, the nation's biggest gun maker, Smith &AMP; Wesson, has
                         incorporated a magazine safety, a mechanism made of a few springs
                         and a lever that can cost as little as 9 cents, in virtually every
                         semiautomatic pistol it sold to the public. Other companies have
                         never used one.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Beretta uses the device in a few models but not others. Some
                         manufacturers offer it as an option to law enforcement but not to
                         the public. One manufacturer stamps a warning about the firing
                         danger onto a pistol. Another puts a caution sticker on the
                         magazine. Others say nothing on the gun.

                            Gun makers have a simple response to questions about the
                         magazine safety, as well as the safety lawsuits: People know that
                         guns are dangerous, gun owners need training, and they need to keep
                         weapons away from children. Faced with the prospect of federal
                         regulation, gun makers recently began to distribute safety locks,
                         but both the industry and groups like the National Rifle
                         Association oppose mandatory safety requirements.

                            ``We leave it up to each individual company to manufacture what
                         they think is the safest, highest quality product as they see fit
                         and leave it to the consumer to buy the gun that best fits their
                         needs,'' said Andrew Kelley, a spokesman for Sporting Arms and
                         Ammunition Manufacturers Institute, a trade group in Newtown, Conn.

                            For every gun maker that cites safety as a reason for using the
                         magazine device, another contends it could make a gun less
                         reliable. Other consumer industries form internal task forces to
                         resolve such debates, or refer them to independent technical
                         groups, such as Underwriters Laboratories Inc., which have set
                         standards for products from children's pajamas to hair dryers.
                         </P>

                            But while the gun industry's group, the Sporting Arms and
                         Ammunition Institute, has set technical standards for bullets, it
                         has not researched the value of internal safety devices like the
                         magazine safety, Kelley said.

                            There is little question that some accidental shooting deaths
                         could be prevented if gun owners handled and stored their weapons
                         more safely. And such deaths have fallen steadily over the last two
                         decades.
