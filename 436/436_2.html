                    <P>
                            It is one of most common gun accidents: A person picks up a
                         semiautomatic pistol, takes out the magazine containing the
                         cartridges and, thinking the weapon is empty, squeezes the trigger
                         and shoots himself or someone else.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            When a semiautomatic's magazine is removed, a round can remain
                         in the chamber, ready to be fired, and scores of people, from
                         adults cleaning guns to children playing with them, have died or
                         been seriously hurt in recent years as a result.
                         </P>

                            Gun producers have long known of the danger, and some have
                         responded by building into their guns an inexpensive mechanism
                         known as a magazine safety. But the fact that many gun makers have
                         chosen not to use simple devices like magazine safeties and gun
                         locks is now a focus of a growing wave of lawsuits in which cities
                         are accusing the firearms industry of making guns needlessly
                         dangerous.

                            A look at how gun makers have chosen to use, or not use, the
                         magazine safety provides a glimpse into an industry driven by
                         unique marketing forces. In the absence of government safety
                         regulation, different companies set their own standards, and
                         producers have not sought independent answers about safety issues
                         or been able to reach internal consensus on them.

                            For decades, the nation's biggest gun maker, Smith &AMP; Wesson, has
                         incorporated a magazine safety, a mechanism made of a few springs
                         and a lever that can cost as little as 9 cents, in virtually every
                         semiautomatic pistol it sold to the public. Other companies have
                         never used one.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Beretta uses the device in a few models but not others. Some
                         manufacturers offer it as an option to law enforcement but not to
                         the public. One manufacturer stamps a warning about the firing
                         danger onto a pistol. Another puts a caution sticker on the
                         magazine. Others say nothing on the gun.

                            Gun makers have a simple response to questions about the
                         magazine safety, as well as the safety lawsuits: People know that
                         guns are dangerous, gun owners need training, and they need to keep
                         weapons away from children. Faced with the prospect of federal
                         regulation, gun makers recently began to distribute safety locks,
                         but both the industry and groups like the National Rifle
                         Association oppose mandatory safety requirements.

                            ``We leave it up to each individual company to manufacture what
                         they think is the safest, highest quality product as they see fit
                         and leave it to the consumer to buy the gun that best fits their
                         needs,'' said Andrew Kelley, a spokesman for Sporting Arms and
                         Ammunition Manufacturers Institute, a trade group in Newtown, Conn.

                            For every gun maker that cites safety as a reason for using the
                         magazine device, another contends it could make a gun less
                         reliable. Other consumer industries form internal task forces to
                         resolve such debates, or refer them to independent technical
                         groups, such as Underwriters Laboratories Inc., which have set
                         standards for products from children's pajamas to hair dryers.

                            But while the gun industry's group, the Sporting Arms and
                         Ammunition Institute, has set technical standards for bullets, it
                         has not researched the value of internal safety devices like the
                         magazine safety, Kelley said.

                            There is little question that some accidental shooting deaths
                         could be prevented if gun owners handled and stored their weapons
                         more safely. And such deaths have fallen steadily over the last two
                         decades.

                            Still, in 1996, the most recent year for which federal data are
                         available, 1,134 people were killed in such incidents, 135 of them
                         children under 14.

                            The shootings occur for various reasons. Many involve hunting.
                         Others happen when a gun is dropped. But a 1991 study by the
                         General Accounting Office, a congressional agency, found that
                         nearly a fourth occurred because the person who picked up a gun
                         thought it was unloaded.

                            No single device _ and gun makers can choose from many _ can
                         eliminate such shootings. But the gun industry's scattershot
                         approach to safety involves producers of inexpensive and costly
                         guns alike.

                            For expensive pistols, the marketing chain often starts with
                         military or police agencies. Gun makers can use their success in
                         that arena to sell the same weapon to consumers.

                         said Joseph Cartabona, director of handguns for Colt's
                         Manufacturing in West Hartford, Conn.

                            Many law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI, do not want a
                         magazine safety. Their reasoning: that being able to fire the
                         bullet remaining in the chamber could save the life of an officer
                         who changes his magazine or accidentally releases it during a
                         gunfight.

                            But firearms experts who have looked for such cases say they
                         have found few. Instead, experts like Massad Ayoob, a police
                         captain who is director of the Lethal Force Institute, a training
                         academy in Concord, N.H., say they have found more instances where
                         officers with magazine safeties avoided being shot with their own
                         guns by ejecting the magazine during a struggle.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``It acts as a kind of kill button,'' Ayoob said.

                            Whatever the merits of the device for police work, guns stripped
                         of safety features for military or police use are then sold to
                         consumers, who often lack training. Such guns include
                         semiautomatics made by Glock Inc., which are used by about half of
                         the country's police departments.

                            Glock pistols, designed in the early 1980s for the Austrian
                         military, have also been a big hit with consumers, who now account
                         for half of all sales. The Glock has several safety features, but
                         lacks both a magazine safety and a manual safety, the lever found
                         on many pistols that must be pushed for the gun to fire.

                            Such mechanical factors combined with poor training may be
                         behind many accidental deaths and injuries involving Glock pistols.
                         In the last decade, about 60 accidental shooting lawsuits have been
                         filed against Glock, of Smyrna, Ga., according to Firearms
                         Litigation Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in Washington, and the
                         company says it is facing about 20 such suits, 40 percent of which
                         involve consumers.

                         <P>
                            Glock denies any blame for the incidents and it has won all nine
                         cases that have gone to trial, said the company's general counsel,
                         Paul Jannuzzo. But it has settled other suits.

                            ``The gun is the best tool of its kind available, be it for a
                         policeman or a civilian,'' Jannuzzo said. ``It strikes the proper

                            Only a few lawsuits specifically charging that an accidental
                         shooting resulted from the lack of a magazine safety have gone to
                         trial, and gun makers have won them. Several more are pending,
                         including one involving the 1996 death of Ross Mathieu, the
                         12-year-old boy in Massachusetts shot by a friend who thought a
                         pistol without its magazine was empty.

                            But in the last three decades, gun makers have quietly settled
                         dozens of such cases, say plaintiffs' lawyers and expert witnesses
                         who have testified for them. Stanton Berg, a firearms consultant in
                         Minneapolis, said he had been involved in about 30 suits involving
                         the lack of a magazine safety, nearly all of which were settled.

                         Ballistics Inc., a consulting firm in Bel Air, Md., said he had
                         been involved in about six cases that were settled. He said that
                         any gun sold to the public should have at least three devices: a
                         manual safety, a magazine safety and a safety to prevent the gun
                         from firing if it is dropped.

                            ``The average civilian has received no training,'' Martin said.
                         ``He needs all the help he can get.''

                         <P>
                            The settlements have not prompted the industry to use magazine
                         safeties. Jeffrey Reh, general counsel of Beretta USA in Accokeek,
                         Md., which has settled two of those cases, said the magazine safety
                         has pros and cons.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Reh said the safety can prevent someone from accidentally firing
                         a gun that they think is unloaded because the magazine is removed.
                         But deadly accidents have happened with guns that have the safety,
                         he said, when someone inserted an empty magazine in the pistol.
                         That disengages the safety and allows the remaining bullet to be
                         fired.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            He also said that a homeowner needing a gun in a hurry for
                         self-defense might not be able to use it if the gun had a safety
                         and he fumbled with a magazine.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``It is what we call a neutral feature,'' Reh said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            That does not explain why some Beretta guns sold to the public
                         have magazine safeties and others do not. Reh said none of the guns
                         made by Beretta in the United States have magazine safeties, but
                         they are included in Berettas made by Fabbrica D'Armi Pietro
                         Beretta, an Italian sister company.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Reh said he did not know for certain why the Italian company
                         used the device, but he said the reason might stem from a 1968
                         federal law aimed at cheap handguns known as ``Saturday night
                         specials,'' most of which came from abroad at the time.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The 1968 law, the federal Gun Control Act, imposed a test based
                         on safety features on imported handguns. But the test did not apply
                         to guns made in the United States, and domestic producers quickly
                         moved in to make inexpensive guns that did not meet the import
                         test.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In recent years, some gun makers have moved to make weapons less
                         dangerous. But within the industry, currents can flow in several
                         directions.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            For decades, virtually every Smith &AMP; Wesson pistol sold to the
                         public had a magazine safety because the company believed it could
                         help prevent accidental shootings, said Kenneth Jorgensen, a
                         spokesman for the gun maker. But several years ago, faced with the
                         popularity of the Glock, Smith &AMP; Wesson started selling a competing
                         line of inexpensive pistols known as its ``Sigma'' series.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The new pistol, like the Glock, does not have a magazine safety.
                         Instead, it bears this warning stamped on the side: ``CAUTION:
                         Capable of firing with the magazine removed.''
