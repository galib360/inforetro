                            Still, Putin said Russia would carry on the military campaign
                         ``to its completion'' and ``finish off terrorists in their own
                         den.''

                            Overnight, combined Russian security forces said they had
                         scoured 160 subway stations and underground passageways using
                         bomb-sniffing dogs to ensure that the capital's public transit
                         system with its extensive maze of interconnecting tunnels was clear
                         of explosives. At Moscow's Kazansky railway station police
                         reportedly found nearly nine pounds of TNT as well as seven
                         detonators, which were not hooked up to the explosives.

                            Wednesday morning, Muscovites were back underground as usual,
                         with thousands of them passing through the reopened, though charred
                         passageways beneath Pushkin Square, where vendors picked through
                         the debris in their shops.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``Of course we will go back to work here,'' said one middle-aged
                         woman sorting through the lingerie in her darkened kiosk. ``And of
                         course we are scared,'' she added.

                            The low granite walls along the exits from the underground
                         passageways had already become memorial altars, where friends,
                         relatives and passersby laid carnations and lilies to express their
                         sympathy for those who died. Russian television reported Wednesday
                         night that Putin, too, visited the square and laid flowers.
                         </P>

                            Police officials said they were working with three witnesses who
                         saw two men bargaining at a leather goods shop in the tunnel and
                         who dashed for an exit leaving a satchel behind that exploded
                         moments after the salesgirl summoned a security officer to inspect
                         the bag.

                            Putin, speaking at the Kremlin, struck a note of calm
                         resolution, admonishing Russians that terrorism was an
                         ``international illness'' for which the only cure was ``political
                         will,'' the ``vigilance of the people'' and effective law
                         enforcement.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Terrorists, he said, ``count on bloodshed, sensation, panic and
                         hysteria.'' And he warned that ``disorganization and disorder would
                         make the best possible gift for them.''
