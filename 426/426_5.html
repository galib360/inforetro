                    <h2> Philippines, U.S. Strengthen Anti-narcotics Cooperation </h2>
                    <P>
                            MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United States
                            pledged Tuesday to strengthen their cooperation in curbing illegal
                            drug trade by expanding their anti-narcotics campaign in the
                            Philippines.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            This was learned from Presidential Spokesman Fernando Barican
                            who was present at the meeting between Philippine President Joseph
                            Estrada and U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Thomas Hubbard at
                            the Presidential Palace.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            "The president and the American ambassador agreed that U.S. and
                            Philippine anti-drug authorities ought to explore innovative ways
                            to curtail the drug trade," Barican said.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            He admitted during his regular press briefing that Hubbard had
                            echoed Washington's concern that the Philippines had been used by
                            foreigners running illegal drug syndicates, as a transshipment
                            point of narcotics bound for the U.S.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            It is due to this concern, Barican said, that the U.S.
                            ambassador had asked President Estrada "to address this kind of
                            problem before it gets to such a stage that it becomes a serious
                            concern."
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            He stressed that although the Philippines has a wide coastline,
                            making it an ideal transshipment point of goods bound for the
                            U.S., the former has not been listed as among the top countries
                            used as jump-off point for drugs that enter the American market.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            To address the problem of drug trafficking, Barican said the
                            Presidential Palace "is considering the creation, in the long
                            term, of a central unified civilian drug enforcement agency,
                            patterned after the American model."
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The U.S. has the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) which is
                            primarily tasked with tracking down the operations of illegal drug
                            syndicates and effect the arrest of traffickers and
                            narcotic-related offenders.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            Barican said such a move would be a long-term goal, as he
                            explained that the creation of an agency similar to the DEA would
                            require legislation, and the enactment of such laws by Congress,
                            normally takes time.
