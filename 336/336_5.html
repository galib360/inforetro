                    <P>
                            STILLWATER, N.J. _ Danette Conroy was upstairs cleaning kitchen
                         cabinets and her year-old daughter Kayleigh was asleep when the
                         black bear somehow got into the ground floor of their new home.
                         They never heard a thing until the crash of breaking glass. The
                         bear, apparently startled by the arrival of Conroy's husband,
                         Chris, had plunged through a double-paned window and stumbled away
                         toward the woods.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I've lived in Stillwater since I was age 4, and now I'm 41,''
                         said Chris Conroy, a hunter, recalling what happened last summer.
                         ``I've never ever, even seen a bear until about five years ago.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            These days, everybody in this township of 4,500 on the slopes of
                         the Kittatinny Mountains of northwestern New Jersey seems to know
                         somebody with a bear story. Charlie McMahon raised goats as a hobby
                         for 15 years until a bear killed two of them three years ago. Two
                         weeks ago, at a Boy Scout camp in nearby Allamuchy, a bear yanked a
                         sleeping bag _ with a teen-ager inside it _ off a bench; the youth,
                         who was uninjured, screamed and frightened off the bear.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            And last summer, a bear broke up Diane Apostola's backyard
                         barbecue for 20 relatives. ``He just came walking down like he was
                         coming to the party with us,'' Apostola said. ``We all ran into the
                         house, and he just left.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            As the numbers of black bears and people have grown in forested
                         areas of the New York region, the bears _ once timid and content
                         with isolated lives in the woods _ are venturing more and more into
                         campgrounds, yards and even houses in search of food. The place
                         where their wanderings have caused the biggest stir is New Jersey;
                         the state Division of Fish and Wildlife said it received 1,659
                         complaints about bears last year, up from 285 in 1995.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Most of the complaints were about bears roaming in backyards and
                         getting into garbage and bird feeders, but 28 of them involved
                         bears killing livestock and 29 were about bears getting into homes.
                         Although none of the complaints involved bears attacking or
                         injuring people, the intrusions have imposed anxieties and
                         restrictions on life in this wooded corner of the state.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The New Jersey Fish and Game Council will hold a public hearing
                         Tuesday on its proposal to allow bear hunting this fall for the
                         first time in 30 years. The council wants to reduce the state's
                         bear population, now estimated at 1,000, to between 250 and 330 in
                         the next three years in order to cut down on encounters between
                         people and bears.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``We see this as a safety issue,'' said John W. Bradway,
                         chairman of the council. ``Some people fear for their children's
                         safety.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The hunting proposal, made last March, is opposed by 22 animal
                         rights groups that want the state to do more to teach people to
                         coexist with bears.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``There's no overpopulation problem,'' said Lynda Smith,
                         director of one such group, the Bear Education and Resource Group
                         of West Milford, N.J. ``If we cut off food in the neighborhoods,
                         the bears won't come in.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But the animals have a keen sense of smell that can penetrate
                         even the strongest barriers to food. Two summers ago, a black bear
                         broke into Carolyn and Michael Ganon's home here by yanking an
                         air-conditioner out of a window and crawling in through the hole _
                         apparently seeking an uncovered canister of chocolate-covered
                         toffee in the family room. Terrified, the couple's son, Leland, 13,
                         ran upstairs and called 911. The police found the animal sitting
                         near the Ganons' porch, calmly eating the candy.
