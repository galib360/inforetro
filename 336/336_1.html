                        <P>
                                SHELL LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- A black bear attacked a teen-age boy  
                            Monday while he slept in a tent at a Boy Scout camp, seriously 
                            injuring him. 
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                Matthew Murphy, 14, was attacked at about 6:30 a.m. at the  
                            Tomahawk Scout Reservation on the east side of Long Lake in 
                            northwestern Wisconsin, authorities said. A search was on for the 
                            bear, which will be destroyed if found. 
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                Murphy was in serious but stable condition Monday night after  
                            undergoing surgery. He had bite wounds to his head and shoulder 
                            area and was expected to make a full recovery, the family said in a 
                            news release. 
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                Murphy's father, Anthony, a leader at the camp, used a rock and  
                            a block of wood to drive the bear away after the animal had dragged 
                            the boy and his tent about 78 feet into the woods. 
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                Candy wrappers were found in the tent, but officials did not  
                            know if that was related to the attack. 
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                Ken Jonas, the wildlife biologist investigating the attack, said  
                            the incident was extremely peculiar. 
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                ``We normally don't get bears that attack people, and certainly  
                            not in this manner,'' Jonas said. 
                                         
                            </P>
