                    <P>
                            There are about 650,000 black bears in North America, and only
                         one person every three years is killed by a bear _ although there
                         are hundreds of thousands of encounters. Most bears in the
                         continental United States are black bears, but black bears are not
                         always black in color: Sometimes their fur is brown or blond. Males
                         are generally bigger than females (125 pounds to 500 pounds for
                         males, 90 pounds to 300 pounds for females).
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Bears can run as fast as horses, uphill or downhill. They can
                         also climb trees.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Bears have excellent senses of smell and hearing _ and they're
                         extremely strong. They can tear cars apart looking for food.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Every bear defends a ``personal space.'' The extent of this
                         space will vary with each bear and each situation; it may be a few
                         feet or a few hundred feet. Intrusion into this space is considered
                         a threat and may provoke an attack.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            It's important to know that bears aggressively defend their
                         food. Stay away from dead animals because bears may attack to
                         defend such food.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Female bears defend their cubs. If a female with cubs is
                         surprised at close range or is separated from her cubs, she may
                         attack.

                         <P>
                            _ Make your presence known by talking loudly, clapping, singing
                         or calling out. Whatever you do, make sure you are heard. It does
                         not pay to surprise a bear.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            _ Keep children close at hand.

                         <P>
                            _ There is no guaranteed minimum safe distance from a bear _ the
                         farther, the better.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            _ If you are in a car, remain in your vehicle. Do not get out,
                         even for a quick photo. Keep your windows up. Do not impede the
                         bear from crossing the road.

                         <P>
                            _ Lie still and quiet. Documented attacks show that an attack by
                         a mother black bear often ends when the person stops fighting.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            _ Stay where you are. Don't try to climb a tree to escape. Black
                         bears can climb trees easily and will come after you. The odds are
                         that the bear will leave you alone if you stay put.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            _ If you are lying still and the bear attacks, strike back with
                         anything you can. Go for the bear's eyes or its snout.
