                    <h2> Russian bear orphanage weans its cubs with `tough love' </h2>

<P>
        BUBONIDZE, Russia (AP) _ Bear hunting season in Russia opened
        Aug. 1, and it might seem an inauspicious time to release two
        motherless bear cubs into the wild.
</P>
<P>
        But father-and-son gamekeepers Valentin and Sergei Pazhetnov are
        former hunters, and they specialize in training bear orphans to
        survive all the dangers of Russia's deep forests, especially
        predators on two legs.
</P>
<P>
        The sister cubs, Prima and Dina, were found by a game warden in
        April. Apparently, a woman had disturbed their den, provoking an
        attack by the mother bear which then ran off and abandoned the
        3-month-old cubs.
</P>
<P>
        For four months, they have lived at the bear orphanage that the
        Pazhetnov family runs as part of an animal sanctuary in Bubonidze,
        a remote settlement 450 kilometers (280 miles) west of Moscow.
              
</P>
<P>
        With the help of international donations, the Pazhetnovs have
        raised and released 64 bear orphans in the last eight years. The
        facility is the only one of its type in Russia.
</P>
<P>
        What sets it apart is that the regimen is not warm and friendly.
Here, the bears are taught with ``tough love,'' and contact with
humans is kept to a minimum. Any gesture of friendliness by the
bears is met with a swift slap on a tender nose.
</P>
<P>
        The reason? Bear cubs raised by humans often become too
trusting, even running up to hunters as if to make friends. So
Valentin, who studied animal behavior at Moscow State University,
has developed a program to care for young bears without letting
them get too attached.
</P>
<P>
        What they're doing is making sure these bears retain their
biological fear of humans,'' says Simon Pope of the Britain-based
International Fund for Animal Welfare, which helps finance the
orphanage.
</P>
<P>
        However, affection flows freely in the other direction.
	   ``It's exactly the same emotion as if our children had left
home,'' says Sergei. ``We looked after them for so long and now
we've released them. But I'm sure they'll survive.''
</P>
<p>
	   Bears are plentiful in Russia, and hunting is considered part of
the national heritage.
</p>
<p>
	   Soviet leaders like Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev showed
off their prowess with a hunting rifle in front of visiting
dignitaries. And there were only a few voices of protest last year
when then Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin killed a bear and her
cubs on a hunting trip.
</p>
<p>
	   Ironically, most cubs are brought to the orphanage by hunters
who have killed a mother bear. Female bears tend to stay in their
lairs in January when nursing their cubs, making them sitting
targets.
</p>
<p>

	   Cubs younger than 3 months have little sight, hearing or sense
of smell, and they can live inside the wooden cottage with Valentin
and his wife, Svetlana.
</p>
<p>
	   But once their senses are active, they are moved to an enclosure
deep in an animal sanctuary where they can learn to climb trees,
dig dens and scavenge for food.
</p>
<p>
	   The Pazhetnovs provide food and veterinary care, but limit
contact as much as possible, touching the bears only with gloves
and rebuffing any overtures of friendship.
</p>
<p>
	   After four months, Valentin decided the cubs Prima and Dina were
ready to return to the woods. Even though bear season is open, most
hunters wait until winter when it's easier to find bears in their
dens. So the cubs will have a few months to get used to being on
their own, dig a den and settle in for winter.
</p>
<p>
	   The cubs, sedated for the car trip, are tagged on the ear and
then awakened when they reach an area near their former den. As
they amble off, they pause for a moment, their heads poking above
the tall grass, and look back toward the humans.
</p>
<p>
	   But just briefly. Within moments, their brown coats fade into
the darkness among the trees.
