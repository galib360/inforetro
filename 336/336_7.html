                            TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) -- Set gray wolves loose in Idaho and you  
                        hear the ranchers' howls. Allow wild turkeys to hob-gobble about 
                        Connecticut and you get letters to the editor. Release a prairie 
                        dog in Colorado and you have the locals up in arms. Literally. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            But up here in the Great Land, talk of troublesome turkeys and  
                        pesky prairie dogs is met with a great big yawn. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Why? Read the license plates, fella. This is The Last Frontier.  
                        The corner of America where critters outnumber people 5-to-1. (Only 
                        critters larger than Dall Sheep are counted in Alaska.) The land 
                        humans and hairy ones share and share alike.

                            As a moose controller on the Talkeetna rail gang, Sunday  
                        Bumanglag's job is to make sure moose don't become moose meat when 
                        the Seward-to-Fairbanks train passes through. Mind you, moose 
                        control can be tricky. Especially if a 7-foot, 1,600-pound bull has 
                        taken a liking to a particular section of track. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Bumanglag normally tries the whistle first.  
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            No response? He blink-blinks the headlights.  
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Moose didn't blink? The foreman CA-RONG!s a warning shot with a  
                        hunting rifle. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            If Bullwinkle still doesn't get the picture, Bumanglag goes to  
                        Plan D. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            He waits.

                        <P>
                            Sometimes, for half an hour. If passengers start to grumble,  
                        Bumanglag makes an announcement: ``We have a stubborn moose, ladies 
                        and gentlemen.'' That's usually enough to turn scowls to smiles. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``I mean, this is moose country,'' Bumanglag says. ``We're just  
                        guests in the mooses' living room.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            In Alaska, critters are everywhere and humans do a pretty good  
                        job of living alongside them. Non-Alaskans might say that's because 
                        farming never took root here and because the state's so big that 
                        humans and animals don't trip over each other. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            But folks here note that while the Paul Bunyans of the Lower 48  
                        were scalping forests and pushing many animals toward oblivion, 
                        Alaskans came to appreciate their critters. 
                        </P>

                            ``The bush makes you a different person,'' says Steve Mahay, an  
                        outdoorsman in Talkeetna, an assemblage of log cabins and house 
                        trailers in Susitna Valley. He earns a living by taking visitors on 
                        trails and on his riverboat to gawk at things non-human in the 
                        bush. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            In Saratoga, N.Y., where he was raised on a farm in the '60s,  
                        Mahay loved catching muskrats in steel traps. When suburbia came 
                        creeping, he gathered his guns and his wife and rode the ``Alaska 
                        Highway'' west in 1972. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Mahay built a trapper's cabin and lived off game meat. With a  
                        .44 magnum and a .22 rifle he killed 11 bears during his first few 
                        years in the bush. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            He doesn't do it anymore, though. ``I don't get any pleasure  
                        shooting them,'' Mahay says. ``Funny how that changed.'' Now he 
                        counts how many bears he spots from his riverboat. His single-day 
                        record: 16.

                            Carole Lloyd, director of the Nature Center at Chugach State  
                        Park, doesn't know Steve Mahay but insists she can explain his 
                        change of heart. ``When you live in the wild,'' she says, ``you 
                        learn tolerance for all living things.''

                            This is a land where bald eagles lunch on poodles and  
                        dachshunds; where flocks of Canada geese keep jetliners in holding 
                        patterns; where an intruder in your home is likely to slobber and 
                        leave a pile on the rug.

                            In Juneau, the state capital, black bears poke through trash  
                        bins, raid bird feeders, even duck into supermarkets. Eight years 
                        ago, a cub entered the Barlett Regional Hospital emergency ward.

                        <P>
                            Laura Stats, a nurse, found the bear sitting on a bed. She fed  
                        it some milk and apples, sedated it, called the Fish and Game 
                        Department and returned to her rounds. 
                        </P>

                            In Anchorage, where half of human Alaska resides, nobody is  
                        surprised to drive home from work and find a moose on the roof. 
                        ``Happens all the time,'' says Rick Sinnott, a wildlife biologist. 
                        At his desk at the Fish and Game Department, the phone rings 
                        nonstop, people calling to report critter capers:

                            ``We still aren't sure if the bear was playing or trying to mate  
                        with it,'' Sinnott says.

                            If there is one misconception humans have about critter country,

                            A couple on vacation from Georgia learned otherwise a few years  
                        ago after stopping at a Valdez gas station. When the woman let her 
                        Chihuahua out to relieve itself, a bald eagle swooped down, 
                        snatched it by the scruff and circled up and off.

                            Alaskans know wild animals are not Disney characters. Moose  
                        cause more than 100 traffic accidents a year in Anchorage. They 
                        destroy fences, eat shrubbery, and ``we tend to have a stomping 
                        every couple of years,'' says Bruce Bartley, a spokesman at Fish 
                        and Game. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            The last death by moose stomping in Anchorage was in January,  
                        1995. Myong Chin Ra, 71, was walking on the University of Alaska 
                        campus when a cow moose charged. He died hours later of multiple 
                        head fractures and internal injuries.

                            Last month in Hoonah, a village in southeastern Alaska, a  
                        grizzly attacked 14-year-old Cody Mills as he walked a trail. The 
                        boy was in surgery for three hours.

                            ``This ain't the zoo,'' says Sgt. Darlene Turner, chief of state  
                        troopers in Kodiak. ``You should appreciate animals, respect them. 
                        But you can't romanticize them.''

                            Investigators were taking photographs at a murder scene when a  
                        moose appeared -- head down, ears back, hackles up. Then it charged.

                            ``We were diving over balconies, running back and forth, around  
                        parked cars trying to get away from that thing,'' Turner remembers. 
                        The smile on her face fades. ``It sounds funny now, but when a 
                        moose's on YOUR tail, it's not that comical.''
