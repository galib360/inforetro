                    <h2> Chess Master Breaks Color Barrier </h2>
                    <P>
                            NEW YORK (AP) -- Maurice Ashley talks about chess the way some  
                        people describe their favorite poem or painting. ``It has a 
                        majesty; it has a mystical beauty,'' he says. ``The pieces come 
                        alive when you know what they can do.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Ashley has devoted his life to chess, and at 33, he has caught a  
                        dream -- and made history. This spring, moving his bishop against an 
                        opponent's queen, he fulfilled the final requirements for becoming 
                        a chess grandmaster, the game's highest rank. He is the first black 
                        person ever to do so. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``It's just been a whirlwind,'' Ashley says, pausing to reflect  
                        at the Harlem middle school where he coached a chess team until 
                        1997. ``I've been thrilled and ecstatic and on a high and unable to 
                        sleep.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            There are only 45 grandmasters in the United States and 470  
                        worldwide. So joining the uppermost ranks of the elite and clubby 
                        chess world wasn't easy for a Jamaican immigrant who spent much of 
                        his adolescence honing his game in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``Maurice almost did it by himself,'' says Jerald Times, a chess  
                        devotee who met Ashley in the park a decade ago. ``He didn't have a 
                        whole Russian chess school, didn't have grandmasters training 
                        him.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Ashley's casual childhood interest in chess got serious when he  
                        played a high school friend nearly 20 years ago. ``He just crushed 
                        me, and I couldn't believe it,'' Ashley recalls with a laugh. ``We 
                        don't take any beatings lying down in my family.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            So at age 14 he stuck his nose into a strategy book and fell in  
                        love. ``I was electrified by the game,'' he says. ``I found my 
                        passion in life.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Ashley's young game wasn't good enough to get him on the team at  
                        Brooklyn Technical High School. Defiant, he joined the Black Bear 
                        School of Chess, a group of obsessed teens and twentysomethings who 
                        played rough-and-tumble games in Prospect Park for hours on end. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            He earned an undergraduate degree in English at City College and  
                        later coached the Mott Hall Dark Knights, a Harlem middle school 
                        chess team. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Ashley loved sharing his passion with young players, and the  
                        team won three national championships. But ``there was something 
                        that was missing,'' he says, ``and that was my own aspirations.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            In fall 1997, he took leave from the Harlem Educational  
                        Activities Fund, which sponsors the middle school program and 
                        others in the neighborhood. With financial support from the group's 
                        president, Ashley devoted himself to chess full time, studying at 
                        his home in the Park Slope neighborhood and flying to tournaments 
                        in Germany, France and Hawaii. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            A natural competitiveness nurtured early on by an immigrant  
                        mother anxious to see him succeed kept Ashley focused and working 
                        hard. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Competitors say he's a cagey, aggressive player who never misses  
                        a chance to gain an advantage on the board. ``You feel that if you 
                        make the slightest mistake, you're going to get crushed,'' says 
                        Times, Ashley's longtime chess pal. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            The new grandmaster's intensity isn't always visible. During  
                        matches, he'll often lean his elbows on the table and hold his head 
                        in his hands as he analyzes the board; other times he leans back, 
                        looking relaxed, as he ponders the pieces. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            In March, Ashley's single-minded devotion paid off. At a  
                        tournament at the Manhattan Chess Club, which counts several 
                        grandmasters among its members, Ashley joined their ranks. He lost 
                        a second-round game to the tournament's lowest-ranked player, but 
                        he rebounded to second place, earning the points he needed for 
                        grandmaster status. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            The coveted title is earned by meeting rigorous requirements in  
                        high-level tournaments within a set period of time. Ashley's 
                        victory carries special meaning. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``The stereotype in this country is that African-Americans don't  
                        do well at things like chess,'' he says. ``I know how brilliant 
                        black people are ... and I feel like my achievement is a small drop 
                        to add to the wonderful intellectual greatness of our heritage.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            He hopes his victory will inspire young minority players,  
                        especially his former students at Mott Hall. Ashley still strolls 
                        smiling through the chess room there, giving tips and pushing the 
                        serious young players to think hard about every move. The kids say 
                        he's become a role model. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``Because he did it, he made me believe that I could do it,  
                        because we're both minority,'' says Brian Ovalle, a seventh-grader 
                        with roots in the Dominican Republic. ``It's like when Jackie 
                        Robinson broke the color barrier. They didn't believe he could do 
                        it, but he broke through.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Ashley would have liked to have a black grandmaster to emulate  
                        when he was young. ``It was tough ... not seeing any black faces,'' 
                        he recalls. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``What I've been blessed to do is show what's possible.''  
                                     
                        </P>
