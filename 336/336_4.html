                    <P>
                            BIG BEND NATIONAL PARK, Texas (AP) -- The yellow, diamond-shaped  
                        signs posted along the twisting road leading up to the Chisos 
                        Mountains serve as a warning. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            But the blackened image in the middle is not of a deer, nor of  
                        pedestrians. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            It is a bear.  
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            To the delight of wildlife scientists and animal lovers, the  
                        black bear has returned to Big Bend National Park and 
                        re-established a population after a 50-year absence caused by 
                        hunting. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``It's probably the most exciting thing since the park's  
                        existence,'' said Raymond Skiles, a wildlife biologist with the 
                        National Park Service. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Now, park officials want to do everything they can to preserve  
                        the population, currently estimated at 20 bears. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            That means two things: keeping humans and their food away from  
                        the creatures, and studying the bears to learn where specifically 
                        they are living, their travel routes and whether they are 
                        inbreeding. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Big Bend officials have picked up a trick or two from their  
                        counterparts who have been dealing with black bears at other 
                        national parks for decades. At least 600,000 black bears are 
                        believed to be in North America today, with more in Alaska than any 
                        other state. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Workers have installed bear-proof trash cans with secure metal  
                        lids and food-storage lockers at campsites and along hiking trails 
                        in the 15,000-acre Chisos Mountains, the new habitat for a group of 
                        bears believed to have migrated from the Sierra del Carmen, a 
                        mountain range just across the border in Mexico. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            What's more, they have put placards on the tables in the park's  
                        only dining room reminding visitors to keep food in cars and 
                        lockers, not tents and coolers. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Park officials hope such measures will avert the types of  
                        problems experienced at some other parks, where hungry bears have 
                        ripped off car doors. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``Big Bend is lucky in that they can start at the outset, taking  
                        advantage of these techniques that other parks have developed to 
                        try to head off nuisance activity,'' said Mike Pelton, an expert on 
                        black bears and a professor of wildlife science at the University 
                        of Tennessee. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            In the early part of the century, black bears inhabited the land  
                        in southwestern Texas that is now Big Bend but were lost to hunting 
                        and trapping by the time the park opened on 800,000 acres in 1944. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            It wasn't until the mid-1980s that people started seeing black  
                        bears in the park's rugged, reddish-brown mountains, wandering 
                        among the drooping junipers and oaks and snacking on the purple 
                        fruit of the prickly pear cactus. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Then, in 1988, a visitor captured snapshots of a mother bear and  
                        three cubs -- the first evidence of a breeding population. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            As the black bear population blooms across the country, more  
                        people are becoming aware that the bear -- often perceived as a 
                        ferocious beast -- is timid and extremely unlikely to attack a 
                        person if left alone. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Only about 40 people have been killed by black bears in North  
                        America this century, said Lynn Rogers, a director of the North 
                        American Bear Center in Minnesota and a retired wildlife biologist 
                        for the U.S. Forest Service. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``People are learning the truth about these bears and are  
                        willing to co-exist with them,'' Rogers said. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Bears subsist on a mostly vegetarian diet of nuts and berries  
                        but will eat meat that is easily obtained. Problems arise if they 
                        get a taste of human food: There have been many cases around the 
                        country in which bears searching for food have broken into houses, 
                        ripped tents and mauled people. Many pesky bears have had to be 
                        shot. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            So far in Big Bend, which welcomes an average of 300,000  
                        visitors a year, no problems have been reported between the new 
                        bear population and park visitors. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Besides hiding food from the bears, Big Bend's preservation  
                        program has another important component: the extensive, three-year 
                        study being conducted by researcher Dave Onorato, a doctoral 
                        student from Oklahoma State University. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Using techniques that are not uncommon for studying black bears,  
                        Onorato is trapping and holding the animals just long enough to 
                        draw blood, take ear tissue and hair and pull a tooth. And, using a 
                        needle, he injects a three-quarter-inch device between the scapula 
                        that gives each bear an individual code that can be read with a 
                        scanner. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            All this poking and prodding is done to determine the number of  
                        bears, their ages and whether they are inbreeding, which could lead 
                        to sterile males. If that turns out to be the case, park officials 
                        may have to import some black bears to diversify the population. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``In order to preserve these bears, it's important that we know  
                        more about them,'' Onorato said. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Before he finishes with a tranquilized bear, Onorato attaches an  
                        electronic collar so that he can track its movements with a 
                        scanner. So far, he's taken samples from and put collars on 12 
                        bears. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            By mapping the bears' movements, Onorato will learn how they are  
                        traveling and how close they are coming to campsites and popular 
                        tourist areas. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``If the park wants to avoid problems, we need to determine  
                        where the bears are spending time,'' he said. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Skiles said he and other park officials hope to use the data  
                        ``to literally manage the people around the bears.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            ``Ultimately,'' he said, ``we just want to preserve this  
                        population and want it to do what it naturally would.'' 
                                     
                        </P>
