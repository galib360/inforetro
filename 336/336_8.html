                                    BASALT, Colo. _ It was bad enough when Steve Solomon and his
                                 wife, Bates, found the skunk crawling around under their bed at 2
                                 a.m. That they could deal with. Sooner or later, Solomon figured,
                                 the critter would make its way out the front door, which they
                                 routinely left open for the breeze. But was the door still open?
                                 Solomon had to check.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    That's when he froze. It was open, all right. But standing only
                                 20 feet away at the compost bin was a large black bear, chomping on
                                 the remains of a cantaloupe.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``It must have been twice my size,'' Solomon said Wednesday,
                                 guessing the bear's weight at 400 pounds or more. ``I had a skunk
                                 behind me, a bear in front of me. I didn't know which one was
                                 worse.''
                                 </P>

                                    Solomon is hardly the only Coloradan who of late has lived out a
                                 Goldilocks tale in reverse. Because of a hot, dry summer that has
                                 withered natural food supplies, and with an ever increasing number
                                 of people living closer to forests and wilderness areas, bears have
                                 been meeting up with humans at an alarming rate throughout the
                                 state.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    So far, only a smattering of human injuries have been reported,
                                 all of them minor. The encounters have been worse on the bears,
                                 more than 25 of which have been put to death this year under
                                 Colorado's two-strikes-and-you're-out policy for those that forage
                                 too close to people. Over the same period last year, the state
                                 killed only six.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Biologists and state officials say that if there are more
                                 summers like this one, and if home construction near mountainous
                                 areas continues at its feverish pace, more dangerous confrontations
                                 are inevitable.
                                 </P>

                                    ``If a bear learns where to find human foods, he's likely to
                                 come back,'' said Chuck Schwartz, an expert in bears as the leader
                                 of the United States Geological Survey's Interagency Grizzly Bear
                                 Study Team, in Bozeman, Mont. ``They have very good memory, and
                                 they don't differentiate. If it's edible, they'll eat it.''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Grizzlies are not to be confused with the black bears roaming
                                 Colorado and other states. Grizzlies, larger than black bears and
                                 more threatening to humans, are generally found only in areas
                                 around two national parks in the northwest Rockies, Yellowstone and
                                 Glacier, putting them at greater distances from population centers.
                                 </P>

                                    Black bears, which are known to attack humans only when they
                                 feel trapped, are commonly found in dense forests and mountain
                                 terrain at high elevations, where they have encountered unsuitable
                                 conditions in Colorado this year. A late spring frost and endless
                                 summer weeks of uncommonly hot and dry weather have cost them their
                                 usual meals of acorns and berries.
                                 </P>

                                    Bears typically eat up to 20 hours a day in the warm months to
                                 put on enough weight to last the winter. Denied their natural
                                 foods, they have been foraging closer to homes and towns to
                                 scavenge landfills, trash cans, even dog dishes, making this year
                                 one of the most active for officials responding to calls from
                                 frightened people throughout the Rocky Mountain West. In Colorado,
                                 reports of bear sightings and encounters now occur almost daily.

                                    ``Everybody has a bear story,'' said Solomon, a jewelry maker
                                 who has lived for 15 years in Basalt (pronounced buh-SALT), a
                                 mountain town 20 miles northwest of Aspen. ``One woman on the next
                                 street down was canning in her kitchen with the door open. A bear
                                 wandered in to help her out.''

                                    ``I know another family,'' he said, ``who eliminated every bit
                                 of food from their house, scrubbed it down and now only eats in
                                 restaurants.''

                                    In Aspen, the food is apparently so tasty that for the first
                                 time bears have been spotted poking into garbage bins along Main
                                 Street this year. Other bears have wandered along streets in Grand
                                 Junction. Tom Theobald, a beekeeper near Boulder, said bears had
                                 twice ravaged his colonies, eating the honey and destroying
                                 equipment at a cost that now exceeds $2,000.
                                 </P>

                                    ``I don't know how they do it,'' he said of the bears'
                                 marauding. ``They must be taking an awful lot of stings.''
                                 </P>

                                    Most encounters this summer have ended peacefully, but some have
                                 taken their toll on the bears, especially those that officials have
                                 previously encountered, tranquilized and tagged. Any tagged bear
                                 that returns to where people live is put to death under the state
                                 program if it can be caught. In addition, property owners have a
                                 right to shoot a bear that is threatening human life.

                                    According to the Colorado Department of Wildlife, 74 black bears
                                 were killed in those two ways through Aug. 31, and the number is
                                 climbing so rapidly that officials say this year could easily
                                 become the worst for the bears in a decade.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Towns like Aspen and Snowmass Village, near bear habitat, are
                                 taking steps to discourage the scavenging by requiring residents to
                                 upgrade garbage receptacles and bringing misdemeanor charges
                                 against those who do not comply.

                                    Here in Basalt, Solomon has begun storing his trash elsewhere.
                                 For the first time since he moved in all those years ago, he is
                                 locking his front door at night.
