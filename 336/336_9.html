                    <h2> Boy Attacked by Bear at Scout Camp </h2>
                    <P>
                            SHELL LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- A black bear attacked a 14-year-old boy  
                        at a Boy Scout camp, dragging him into the woods and injuring him 
                        before his father drove the animal off by pelting him with rocks 
                        and wood. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Matthew Murphy, 14, had bite wounds to his head and shoulder  
                        area and was in serious condition at a hospital after Monday's 
                        attack. He is expected to make a full recovery, the family said. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            A search was on for the bear, which will be destroyed if found.  
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            The boy was attacked at 6:30 a.m. Monday at the Tomahawk Scout  
                        Reservation on Long Lake in northwestern Wisconsin. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            The bear dragged both boy and tent into the woods. The boy's  
                        father, Anthony Murphy, threw a rock at the bear, which ran off but 
                        then came after him. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            The father then threw a block of wood at the bear, and it  
                        climbed part up a tree, allowing the the boy to be rescued from the 
                        tent. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Candy wrappers were found in the tent, but officials did not  
                        know if that was related to the attack. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Ken Jonas, the wildlife biologist investigating the attack, said  
                        the incident was peculiar: ``We normally don't get bears that 
                        attack people, and certainly not in this manner.'' 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Wildlife wardens on Monday patrolled the camp to protect the 800  
                        campers, many from Minnesota and Wisconsin. Camp fires were also 
                        lit for the night. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            The camp has gotten about 40 calls from concerned parents, but  
                        no requests to pull children from the camp, said Jeff Sulzbach, 
                        director for Tomahawk Scout Reservation. 
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Bear populations have increased to about 14,000 in Wisconsin,  
                        from the 5,850 estimated to be in the state in 1985. 
                                     
                        </P>
