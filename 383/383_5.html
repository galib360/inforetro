                                    DENVER _ As a debate over the growing use of behavioral drugs
                                 for children intensifies across the country, the Colorado Board of
                                 Education has passed a resolution meant to discourage teachers from
                                 recommending prescription drugs like Ritalin and Luvox for
                                 students.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The resolution carries no legal weight. But as the first of its
                                 kind in the nation, it urges teachers and other school personnel to
                                 use discipline and instruction to overcome problem behavior in the
                                 classroom, rather than to encourage parents to put their children
                                 on drugs that are commonly prescribed for attention deficit and
                                 hyperactive disorders.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Proponents of the resolution, which passed by a 6-1 vote Nov.
                                 11, said they were motivated, in part, by evidence that they said
                                 suggests dozens of violent crimes in recent years, including the
                                 massacre last spring at Columbine High School, were committed by
                                 young people taking psychotropic drugs.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    One of the teen-age shooters at Columbine, Eric Harris, had been
                                 taking Luvox, an anti-depressant, although there is no evidence
                                 that the drug had anything to do with the shootings.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    No other states are considering a measure similar to the one in
                                 Colorado, where an unusual set of circumstances played a role in
                                 the resolution's passage: an elected and fairly conservative school
                                 board responding, in part, to the outcry from one of the nation's
                                 worst school shootings. But the resolution reflects broader issues,
                                 as well, as parents, mental health professionals and school
                                 officials around the country debate the rising use of behavioral
                                 drugs for children.
                                 </P>
