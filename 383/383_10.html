                <div>
                    <h2> MEDICATION FOR PROBLEM STUDENTS: POSSIBLE SOLUTION OR UNACCEPTABLE
                            RISK?  </h2>
                            <P>
                                    Dr. Stephen Stahl, a professor of psychiatry at the University
                                 of California in San Diego, said that because of the complexities
                                 of mental disorders and the rapidly changing personalities of
                                 children as they grow older, both sides of the psychotropic debate
                                 may be right. And wrong.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``There's no blood test for this,'' he said. ``It's not
                                 objective. If a kid is acting out in class and a stimulant like
                                 Ritalin calms him down, it would be immoral not to give him the
                                 medicine.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``But the problem comes,'' he added, ``when the stimulants don't
                                 work and parents give them anyway as an excuse to avoid tough
                                 decisions or talking with teachers and doctors to learn what's
                                 going on.''
                                 </P>

                                    Another problem complicating the issue, Stahl said, is the
                                 location of the school. Typically, he said, in poor areas, mental
                                 disorders are underdiagnosed, and often in more affluent school
                                 districts, children are overdiagnosed, sometimes making a bad
                                 situation worse.
                                 </P>

                                    Besides complaints from parents about insistent teachers, Ms.
                                 Johnson said she was also motivated to propose the resolution by
                                 the violent crimes involving young people, in which investigators
                                 said the perpetrators were using psychotropic drugs. Accounts of
                                 those incidents also persuaded a Colorado state lawmaker, Penn
                                 Pfiffner of Lakeland, to hold a separate hearing on the issue,
                                 which, by coincidence, came two days before the school board voted
                                 on Ms. Johnson's measure.
                                 </P>

                                    Dr. Peter Breggin, director of the International Center for the
                                 Study of Psychiatry and Psychology, a nonprofit research
                                 organization in Bethesda, Md., testified at both hearings and said
                                 doctors have become too eager to prescribe psychotropic drugs at
                                 the expense of conversations among parents, teachers and children
                                 to learn why children are acting in anti-social ways.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``It's a tremendous mistake to subdue the behavior of children
                                 instead of tending to their needs,'' Breggin said in an interview.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``We're drugging them into submission rather than identifying
                                 and meeting the genuine needs of the family, the school and the
                                 community. It's wrong in principle.''
                                 </P>

                                    Citing Harris and other young killers who were found to be
                                 taking Ritalin and other drugs, Breggin said he is convinced that
                                 there is a direct link between the drugs and violent acts. He also
                                 asserted that the drug harms children.
                                 </P>

                                    CHADD executive director Matthew Cohen and others said the
                                 resolution might inhibit teachers from applying their own common
                                 sense and experience in the case of a troublesome child by merely
                                 telling parents that something is wrong without offering a full
                                 range of possible solutions.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``If a child has hearing or vision problems that the teacher
                                 identifies, we would expect the teacher to talk to the parents,''
                                 said Jeanne Mueller Rohner, executive director of the Mental Health
                                 Association of Colorado, which opposed the resolution. ``It should
                                 be the same thing for mental health.''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Opponents of the measure also said they were uncomfortable with
                                 the ardent support offered the measure by the Church of Scientology
                                 through an affiliate organization, the Citizens Commission on Human
                                 Rights. The president of its American branch, Bruce Wiseman, who
                                 described the commission as a ``psychiatric watchdog group,''
                                 testified at both hearings and urged rejection of Ritalin and other
                                 drugs as a solution to troublesome behavior.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    But Ms. Johnson, as well as Pfiffner, said the commission's
                                 support was not a critical factor in any of their actions.
                                 </P>
