                    <P>
                            The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s touched off intense concern
                         and a vast amount of research about the safety of drugs taken
                         during pregnancy. Many drugs (and druglike substances, including
                         coffee, alcohol and tobacco) were tested in laboratory animals or
                         studied in pregnant women. Some were found to be potential hazards
                         to developing fetuses, usually only at the beginning of pregnancy
                         but in some cases only near the time of birth and in others
                         throughout gestation.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Now most pregnant women are cautioned to avoid any and all
                         medications that are not absolutely essential, as well as
                         ``pleasure drugs'' like alcohol and tobacco and sometimes coffee
                         and caffeine. But while this is sound advice in general, it can
                         often result in needless discomfort for women who avoid taking a
                         harmless drug that could help them. It also causes undue anxiety
                         among those women who must take medication or who inadvertently
                         took one or more drugs before they knew they were pregnant.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In December 1968, for example, I got the Hong Kong flu the day I
                         was expecting the start of menses. Frequent doses of aspirin kept
                         me from burning up, but 10 days later I remained seriously ill and
                         still had not gotten my period. Now I was coughing so hard I
                         cracked a rib. This time the diagnosis was double pneumonia, for
                         which antibiotics and codeine cough medicine were prescribed. Two
                         weeks later, my gynecologist informed me that I was pregnant. When
                         I asked the doctor about the harm that might have been done by the
                         drugs I had taken, he replied reassuringly, ``If you had not taken
                         them and had died of pneumonia, you would not be having any baby.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Still, I spent the next eight months fretting about the harm
                         that might have resulted to my unborn child. But by what seemed at
                         the time to be a miracle, 36 weeks after contracting the flu I gave
                         birth to perfectly healthy, full-term identical twin boys.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            I have since learned that it is reasonably safe for pregnant
                         women to take a number of drugs in common use, though they should
                         consult their doctors before taking any drug. Even some vaccines,
                         including the flu vaccine, are safe to administer to pregnant
                         women. Furthermore, most medications pose no hazard to a nursing
                         infant because the amount that gets into breast milk is usually too
                         small to have a noticeable effect on the baby.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Let's start with a general recommendation from Dr. Jennifer R.
                         Niebyl, head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa
                         College of Medicine, who says, ``Pregnant women should be
                         discouraged from using over-the-counter drugs for trivial
                         indications.'' Thus, a common cold is best treated with rest,
                         fluids, a humidifier and, if needed, a saltwater (saline) nasal
                         spray like Ocean. Topical medications, like a decongestant nasal
                         spray, are safer than oral ones, and if any cold remedy is used,
                         combination drugs are best avoided. Cough remedies containing
                         iodide should be avoided because they may cause a large goiter in
                         an unborn child.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            For aches and pains, try local applications of heat and rest.
                         But if, say, you have a headache you can't shake and it's
                         interfering with your life, acetaminophen (like Tylenol) is safer
                         than aspirin near the end of pregnancy because it does not prolong
                         bleeding and is not toxic to newborns.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            To reduce the risk of vaginal yeast infections, a common problem
                         among pregnant women, antibiotics should be used only when needed
                         to control a known bacterial infection. Safe antibiotics include
                         penicillin and its derivatives, erythromycin and the
                         cephalosporins. On the other hand, sulfonamides are best avoided in
                         the third trimester, and tetracyclines, which cause discoloration
                         of babies' teeth, should not be used beyond 25 weeks of gestation.
                         </P>
