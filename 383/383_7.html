                                    Experts in children's mental health issues point out that
                                 children who take the drugs do so because they were having
                                 difficulties to begin with. They acknowledge that impulsive or
                                 violent behavior is a recognized side effect in a small percentage
                                 of people taking the drugs.
                                 </P>

                                    But in arguing that an overwhelming majority of children who use
                                 the drugs are benefiting, they contend that the Colorado resolution
                                 is irresponsible and perhaps even dangerous in that it could lead
                                 school personnel to ignore signs of serious mental disorders in
                                 children and that it would discourage communication between
                                 teachers and parents.
                                 </P>

                                    ``I hope what happened in Colorado is the exception and not the
                                 rule,'' said Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental
                                 Health Association, conceding that he fears other states and school
                                 districts might replicate Colorado's efforts.
                                 </P>

                                    ``Holding up psychotropic medicines as the possible cause of
                                 violent behavior is absurd. There's a wealth of information to show
                                 that they have helped dramatically.''

                                    The use of Ritalin and other psychotropic drugs has steadily
                                 increased over the years among school-age children to a current
                                 level of about 2.5 million, according to Children and Adults with
                                 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a national nonprofit
                                 organization known as CHADD, which is based in Landover, Md.

                                    Here in Colorado, increased usage has turned a new focus onto
                                 the role that teachers and administrators play in the daily lives
                                 of children who attend their schools. It has also pitted experts
                                 who say use is growing because the drugs are beneficial against
                                 those who contend that parents and teachers are too quick to seek
                                 out prescription medicine as the simplest way to treat children
                                 with behavioral problems.

                                    Patti Johnson, the Colorado school board member who organized a
                                 hearing on the issue and proposed the resolution, said that in the
                                 five years she has served on the board, she has received ``numerous
                                 complaints'' from parents who claimed a teacher had insisted that
                                 their child go on Ritalin or another drug before returning to
                                 class.
                                 </P>

                                    Recounting the case of one girl, who was showing signs of
                                 attention deficit disorder through mood sweeps and napping in
                                 class, Ms. Johnson said the girl was later diagnosed to be
                                 suffering from hypoglycemia and just needed to change her diet.
                                 According to the girl's parents, Ms. Johnson said, the teacher told
                                 them, ``You need to get her a prescription for Ritalin.''
                                 </P>

                                    As a result, she said, a resolution was designed to remove
                                 school personnel from any medical decisions. She said the board,
                                 which consists of six Republicans and one Democrat, passed the
                                 resolution along party lines with minimal debate. The lone
                                 Democrat, Gully Stanford, did not return a telephone call. No other
                                 versions of of the resolution were considered.

                                    ``The resolution does not stop teachers from communicating with
                                 parents,'' Ms. Johnson said in an interview. ``What it does do is
                                 stop teachers from giving parents an ultimatum: `Put your kid on a
                                 drug or we're not going to teach them.' That can't happen any more.
                                 It's wrong.''

                                    Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association
                                 of State Boards of Education, said that Colorado's is one of only
                                 seven elected state boards of education in the country and those
                                 boards tend to be more ideological.

                                    She added, however, ``I agree that too often the first answer
                                 for children with some behavior problem is to reach for medication.
                                 Some of the numbers we are seeing for medication of children are
                                 staggering.''

                                    Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards
                                 Association, said she knew of no other school board examining the
                                 question. She added that while many are concerned about
                                 overmedication, ``We would be reluctant to support such a
                                 resolution because there are children who may need such services,
                                 who may benefit from the medication.''
