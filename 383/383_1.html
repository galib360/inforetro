                                DAYTON, Ohio _ The benefits of psychotherapy and social support,
                             long recognized in treating depressive disorders, also are gaining
                             acceptance as an essential element in treating schizophrenia and
                             other mental illnesses that involve psychoses.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                ``We know that people with severe mental illness need more than
                             a pill and a doctor's visit,'' says Laurie Flynn, executive
                             director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI).
                             Vicki Lynn Bentley of Dayton, founder of the area's Schizophrenics
                             Anonymous (SA) support group chapter, has known that for a long
                             time.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                ``The medication is like a Band-Aid,'' says Bentley, explaining
                             the value of her psychotherapy at the VA Medical Center. ``A person
                             has symptoms _ hearing voices, anxiety, whatever _ and medication
                             alone is just like sticking a Band-Aid on a cut without adding any
                             medicine to it. The cut will take a lot longer to heal, if it ever
                             does heal.''
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                Schizophrenia is a disorder characterized by delusions and
                             hallucinations, according to University of Florida researchers who
                             reported last month on brain structure differences that could lead
                             to tools for diagnosing or predicting the illness. The roughly 2.5
                             million schizophrenics in the United States might hear voices no
                             one else hears or sense they're being spied on or persecuted, but
                             they do not have the multiple personalities that pop culture often
                             erroneously attributes to them.
