                            ``It's marked by a feeling of: `I don't belong,''' says
                         psychologist Dennis O'Grady, who treats schizophrenics individually
                         and works with SA. ```And you're telling me by how you're treating
                         me that I am correct.'''

                            Therapy helps schizophrenics see that the world isn't as
                         threatening and dangerous as their instincts tell them, O'Grady
                         says. It also can teach them how to cope with everyday stresses,
                         says Bentley, ``how to think of alternatives rather than suicide.''

                            From cooking to people skills, she says, the mentally ill need
                         to learn life fundamentals that others take for granted. ``I don't
                         know why society thinks if you're mentally ill, you can't learn
                         anything. Nothing could be farther from the truth.''

                            In recent months, NAMI has tried to make support and knowledge
                         more available for those with psychoses by establishing what it
                         calls COPE, for Caring, Outreach, Partnership and Education. The
                         resource program, also directed toward family members, includes a
                         consumer guide about patient empowerment, a housing guide, a family
                         guide with productive ways of coping and a resource directory.
