                            COMPANIES </h2>

                            <P>
                                    Hours after executives of American Home Products Corp. and
                                 Warner-Lambert Co. announced a $70 billion merger agreement
                                 Thursday, Pfizer Inc. tried to break the deal up with an $82.4
                                 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Stock analysts who follow the pharmaceutical industry said
                                 Thursday night that a still-higher offer could emerge for
                                 Warner-Lambert, either from American Home or Pfizer, or even from
                                 another drug company. Warner-Lambert's board met Thursday night and
                                 reaffirmed its commitment to American Home, saying that the terms
                                 of Pfizer's offer, which call for the elimination of a $2 billion
                                 payment agreed to by Warner-Lambert and American Home if one
                                 company backed out of their deal, made the bid difficult to
                                 evaluate.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Warner-Lambert is considered a prize within the industry because
                                 of its blockbuster products, including the cholesterol-fighting
                                 drug Lipitor marketed jointly with Pfizer, and its many other
                                 treatments under development.
                                 </P>

                                    Competition has become intense among the world's largest drug
                                 makers to ensure a pipeline of lucrative breakthrough drugs _
                                 compounds that are billion-dollar sellers and control a commanding
                                 share of the market. Companies also need to replace drugs losing
                                 patent protection, which become vulnerable to cheaper generic
                                 products, and want to amass bigger research budgets in the hope of
                                 generating highly successful drugs.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Pfizer's bid for Warner-Lambert shatters all such records in the
                                 industry. The $82.4 billion offer is, in fact, the biggest hostile
                                 bid ever made for any company, and the deal, if completed, would be
                                 one of the largest of any sort.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    If Pfizer were to acquire Warner-Lambert, it would be by far the
                                 biggest drug company. Astra Zeneca, now the world's largest, had
                                 $10.68 billion in worldwide prescription drug sales last year and
                                 4.2 percent of the market.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would have $15.9 billion in sales and
                                 a 6.3 percent share. Drug-stock analysts said that because Pfizer
                                 would have a relatively small share of a splintered market, and
                                 because the companies had little overlap, antitrust issues were not
                                 expected to be a factor in completing a deal.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    If, on the other hand, Warner-Lambert were to complete its
                                 friendly merger with American Home Products, the combined
                                 AmericanWarner would still be the biggest drug company, but with
                                 sales of $13.8 billion and 5.5 percent of the total market.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    It is unclear how Warner-Lambert's 43,000 employees, 3,000 of
                                 whom work in New Jersey, would fare in a Pfizer acquisition. Some
                                 analysts said Pfizer would probably close Warner-Lambert's
                                 headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., and cut other jobs from the
                                 company's confectionary or manufacturing divisions. Pfizer, which
                                 is based in New York City, has 46,400 employees spread worldwide.
                                 The company said Thursday that it expected $1.2 billion in cost
                                 savings once the acquisition was completed.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Analysts said some jobs at Warner-Lambert's headquarters would
                                 almost certainly be eliminated if it merged with American Home. At
                                 their news conference, the companies' executives announced that
                                 AmericanWarner would be based in American Home Products' corporate
                                 center in Madison, N.J.. But they declined to specify how many jobs
                                 might be lost. They estimated cost savings of $1.2 billion
                                 annually.
                                 </P>

                                    Pfizer's bid leaves American Home Products in a potentially
                                 vulnerable position. When announcing the deal with Warner-Lambert,
                                 American Home's chief executive said his third attempt at a merger
                                 would be a charm. Previous agreements between American Home and
                                 SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto fell apart over conflicts on who
                                 would have executive control. Though that matter had apparently
                                 been worked out with Warner-Lambert, the issue may not be so easily
                                 resolved now.
                                 </P>

                                    As evidence of the uncertain fortunes for American Home, its
                                 stock price fell Thursday, even though the company had become an
                                 acquisition target, something that would normally push up a
                                 company's stock price. Investors seemed to wonder whether it could
                                 fetch a premium over its current price.

                                    Stock analysts said Thursday that it could be months before any
                                 merger deal is finalized for any of the companies involved. Several
                                 European companies _ including Glaxo Wellcome and Novartis _ have
                                 long been seen as possible acquirers in the industry, especially if
                                 they can increase their prescription drug sales in the United
                                 States.

                                    ``When it comes to figuring out which company may make an

                                 that their bid would be successful, questions remained. American
                                 Home Products and Warner-Lambert agreed that ending their merger
                                 would cost $2 billion to the party backing out, and they included a
                                 clause in the contract making an exchange of shares difficult for
                                 another company.

                                    Upon making its offer, Pfizer immediately filed a lawsuit in
                                 Delaware, where most big companies are incorporated, contesting the
                                 $2 billion break-up fee. William Steere, Pfizer's chairman, said
                                 Thursday in an interview that Pfizer's offer was contingent on both
                                 roadblocks being removed. He called the break-up fee ``egregious
                                 and unheard of'' for a deal of that size.
