                    <h2> VOTER PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE NATIONAL CONSTITUENCY OF THE MENTALLY
                            ILL  </h2>
                            <P>
                                    On the morning of the 1996 presidential election, Sharon Denny
                                 drove to the local polling place, an elementary school in her
                                 Houston neighborhood. On the way, she gave herself a pep talk.
                                 ``This is so important,'' she told herself. ``And it makes such a
                                 difference to our country. You have got to go vote.''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    But standing in line for the voting booth, Ms. Denny grew
                                 anxious. What if she got inside and did not know what to do? What
                                 if she punched the wrong holes? She broke into a cold sweat, she
                                 recalls, and she remembers thinking, ``This is why they don't want
                                 people with mental illness to vote, because what if I get up there
                                 and I really want to vote for Bill Clinton and I don't, I end up
                                 voting for Dole?''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Defeated, Ms. Denny, who has suffered from manic-depression for
                                 35 years, returned home, her ballot uncast, as it has been in every
                                 election since she first registered to vote 15 years ago.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    But in next year's presidential election, Ms. Denny, 51, knows
                                 that she will make it to the front of the line, and that she will
                                 finally vote for the candidates and initiatives that she believes
                                 in.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    She is certain of this because in August she joined the Mental
                                 Health Voter Empowerment Project, an effort to create a nationwide
                                 constituency of people with mental illness by locating potential
                                 voters _ whether in hospitals, at advocacy events, in housing
                                 projects, clinics or support groups _ registering them, educating
                                 them about mental health issues and making sure they get to the
                                 polls on Election Day 2000.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    It remains to be seen whether such an effort will be embraced by
                                 politicians, especially in a climate where they must respond to
                                 highly publicized incidents of violence involving mental illness,
                                 like the death of Kendra Webdale, who was pushed off a New York
                                 subway platform by a man suffering from schizophrenia.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Complicating the issue further, many politicians have only
                                 recently become aware of mental health as a political issue: a few
                                 even believe, mistakenly, that the mentally ill cannot vote.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    A volunteer from the project will call to remind Ms. Denny to
                                 vote, accompany her to the polling place and help her in the voting
                                 booth, if necessary. Ms. Denny will arrive fully informed about the
                                 candidates, and in particular about their stands on topics of
                                 concern to the mentally ill, like equal health insurance coverage
                                 for psychiatric illnesses, HMO reform, involuntary commitment and
                                 financing for mental health programs and services.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    An estimated 44 million Americans meet the diagnosis criteria
                                 for some form of mental disorder, according to the National
                                 Institute of Mental Health, and 5.6 million of those live with a
                                 serious mental illness, like schizophrenia or manic depression.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    In theory, such numbers could represent a powerful voting bloc,
                                 one any political candidate might feel obliged to court. But people
                                 with severe mental illness, who often subsist on disability
                                 benefits and may spend years bouncing from psychiatric hospitals to
                                 jails to the streets, have been ignored by politicians because they
                                 offered neither money nor votes.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Ken Steele, who started the voter empowerment project in New
                                 York City in 1994, said that the idea came to him after hearing a
                                 speech by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. In the speech, Steele
                                 recalled, Cuomo said that his signing of a mental health bill was
                                 ``a good and compassionate thing,'' but that it was not smart
                                 politics, because the mentally ill did not vote.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Over the next four years, Steele, a veteran of 35 years spent in
                                 state hospitals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, registered an
                                 estimated 28,000 New York City voters. And 15,000 of those newly
                                 registered voters, he and his staff of volunteers learned through
                                 their tracking efforts, cast their votes in the November 1998
                                 election.
                                 </P>

                                    Now the Mental Health Association of New York State, backed by a
                                 federal grant and financing from a pharmaceutical company, is
                                 expanding Steele's project throughout the state, and the Mental
                                 Health Association of Houston and Harris County has launched its
                                 own version of the program. The National Mental Health Association,
                                 which has its headquarters in Alexandria, Va., will hold regional
                                 training sessions for the project beginning this fall in Orlando,
                                 Los Angeles and Atlanta.
                                 </P>

                                    ``We'd like to have our issues be part of the 2000 debate,''
                                 said Joseph Glazer, president of the New York association, ``and
                                 the only way to get our issues to that level is to have a strong
                                 base of registered voters and a sufficient voice so that the mental
                                 health consumer community has to be listened to.''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Steele compared the fight for political visibility to earlier
                                 struggles by women and African-Americans: ``This is a civil rights
                                 movement, like those that preceded it. Every one of those movements
                                 began with access to the vote. Until we, the mental health
                                 consumers, are seen as a constituency of consequence, we will not
                                 close the holes in the mental health system.''
                                 </P>
