                    <P>
                            The drug metronidazole, commonly used to treat intestinal
                         parasites, is best avoided in the first trimester. Lindane (as in
                         Kwell), formerly widely used to treat lice infestations, should be
                         avoided entirely during pregnancy, and pregnant women should wear
                         rubber gloves when treating children for head lice; safer
                         alternatives are the pyrethroids with piperonyl butoxide (Rid and
                         R&AMP;C, for example) or a fine-toothed comb.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The new nonsedating antihistamines used to treat allergies have
                         not been tested for safety in pregnancy. But women who have been
                         receiving desensitization shots can continue to do so at a
                         maintenance dose during pregnancy. Women with asthma can safely use
                         theophylline, aminophylline, terbutaline and cromolyn sodium. And
                         it may surprise you to learn that the potent immune-suppressing
                         drugs prednisone and prednisolone are considered drugs of choice
                         during pregnancy because they are nearly completely inactivated by
                         the placenta.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Also safe are alphamethyldopa and propranolol to treat chronic
                         hypertension. For women plagued by heartburn, antacids are safe for
                         use in any trimester, but bicarbonate of soda, magnesium
                         trisilicate and the new H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are
                         potentially toxic to the fetus.

                            Reports on the safety of the new antidepressants called
                         selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI.'s) have been mixed.
                         One large study of Prozac found no increase in miscarriage or major
                         birth defects, but infants exposed in the womb were more likely to
                         have minor defects. The latest report, based on 524 pregnancies,
                         half of which involved the use of an SSRI, found no increase in
                         major malformations, miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth
                         associated with the either the SSRI's or tricyclic antidepressant
                         drugs taken in recommended doses during pregnancy.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Although most medications taken in normal doses by a nursing
                         mother are safe for infants, a few are definitely too toxic for a
                         baby. These include chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer; lithium to
                         treat bipolar disorder and drugs like cyclosporine that suppress
                         the immune system. Even when taking a safe drug, a nursing mother
                         would be wise to coordinate the dosages with the baby's schedule,
                         just after the baby has been fed or before the baby's longest
                         sleep.
                         </P>

                         during pregnancy, see ``I'm Pregnant and I Have a Cold'' by Dr.
                         Craig V. Towers, a perinatologist in California at Long Beach
                         Memorial Medical Center, just published by RBC Press ($27.95 in
                         hardcover, $14.95 in paperback). Other Substances of Concern

                            Barbara K. Hackley, a nurse midwife at the Yale School of
                         Nursing, recently reviewed the safety of immunizations during
                         pregnancy in The Journal of Nurse-Midwifery. She approves of the
                         toxoid and inactivated vaccines _ tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B,
                         influenza and pneumococcal vaccines _ although she advises that
                         even these vaccines are best given in the second and third
                         trimesters in case they may have some effect yet unrecognized on a
                         young fetus. Flu vaccine (taken each fall to include the latest
                         strains) is now recommended for all pregnant women. To be avoided
                         are live virus and bacterial vaccines, including those for measles,
                         mumps, rubella and chicken pox.

                            Legal recreational drugs like alcohol, nicotine and caffeine are
                         also common concerns among pregnant women. Cigarette smoking during
                         pregnancy can compromise fetal growth, resulting in babies that are
                         smaller than they should be at birth, and may also cause
                         long-lasting intellectual deficits. Heavy consumption of alcohol
                         during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome marked by subnormal
                         growth, muscle and heart damage, and low intelligence or mental
                         retardation. Although an occasional drink is highly unlikely to
                         have any adverse effect on a developing fetus, the Food and Drug
                         Administration advises pregnant women to refrain from drinking any
                         alcohol.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Caffeine and coffee, on the other hand, have been pretty much
                         cleared of earlier suspicions of fetal harm, at least when consumed
                         in moderation: no more than three cups of coffee a day. In 1980,
                         after reports of birth defects in mice induced by caffeine, the FDA
                         warned pregnant women to limit their intake of coffee. But
                         considerable evidence accumulated since has not implicated coffee
                         as a cause of birth defects in humans. Still, there is some
                         evidence that consuming more than three cups of coffee a day may
                         slightly reduce birth weights.
