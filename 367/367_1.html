                                BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide campaign to collect
                                one million signatures was begun here today by the China Software
                                Alliance (CSA), an alliance of 12 major Chinese software
                                producers, to promote awareness of protecting intellectual
                                property rights of software.
                                </P>
                                <P>
                                The program is to last in 44 cities until the end of the year.
                                </P>

                                Chen Chong, deputy director of China's Ministry of Electronics
                                Industry, said that China has a system of laws protecting
                                intellectual property rights and has made great advances in this
                                field.

                                The anti-piracy campaign will have a great influence on the
                                Chinese and will provide a sound environment for software
                                developers, Chen said.
                                </P>

                                China adopted its Copyright Law, which listed software as one
                                of the key intellectual products to be protected, in 1991, and
                                passed the Computer Software Protection Regulations in the same
                                year.
                                </P>

                                It is vital for China to develop its software industry as
                                quickly as possible, because the country is in urgent need of new,
                                high-tech products to improve its industries, Chen noted.

                                A manager of the Lianbang Software Company in Beijing, which
