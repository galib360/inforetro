                    <P>
                            Everything seemed fine that spring afternoon as Capt. Ken Blyth
                         watched over the loading of his ship in Singapore. He was
                         skippering the Petro Ranger, a medium-size tanker with a $1.5
                         million cargo of jet fuel and diesel oil bound for Ho Chi Minh
                         City. It was a three-day turnaround. No big deal. After it was
                         over, he'd fly back to his home in Queensland, Australia, to
                         celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary the following week with his
                         wife, Denise.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            When the Petro Ranger finally slipped its berth, it was just
                         another cargo vessel amid the daily parade that makes Singapore the
                         busiest port in the world. Not far outside the harbor is the
                         Horsburgh Lighthouse, the last outpost of domestic law. From
                         Horsburgh on, you pass into the only true frontier of the 21st
                         century: international waters _ the no-man's land of the new world
                         economy. Not technically owned or patrolled by anyone, these waters
                         are the last place on earth where you are truly alone.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            That night, a Malaysian sailor of Indian extraction was the
                         officer of the watch, but instead of performing his duties, he
                         tuned the shortwave to his favorite Indian music station and didn't
                         pay attention to the radar screen.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Just after 1 a.m., the blue speedboat opened its engines.
                         Cruising straight up the wake, without any threat of detection, it
                         pulled up to the ship's stern. There were 12 pirates on board _ as
                         multicultural as their 18th-century avatars: seven Indonesians,
                         three Malaysians and two Thais. They had learned the layout of the
                         ship beforehand and moved with feline grace. Securing bamboo
                         ladders to the stern, the men scrambled to the main deck and leapt
                         upon the outside ladder of the accommodation housing, climbing five
                         stories to the open bridge. Dressed in jeans and T-shirts and with
                         balaclavas pulled over their faces, they appeared in the bridge's
                         doorway. They were armed with machetes. The officer of the watch
                         panicked and fled the chart room by a back exit. The lookout was
                         overtaken in a struggle that thumped the floor loudly enough to
                         awaken the captain below.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Blyth sat up in the dark, thinking perhaps that someone on the
                         bridge had been drinking. Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of
                         a loud banging at his door. Instinctively, he unlocked it. The door
                         blew open. Four hooded pirates waving machetes rushed in. A fifth
                         pirate stepped forward with a gun. He put the barrel to Blyth's
                         head and ordered the captain to place his hands in front of him.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The pirates bound Blyth with boat lacing. He would remain bound
                         for the next 13 days.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I still have burn marks on my wrists,'' Blyth, 55, a tall,
                         blue-eyed Scot, recently told me.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``The pirates wanted me to go around with the master key _ the
                         one the captain has to unlock any door _ and round up the crew,''
                         Blyth recalled of that April 17, 1998, night. ``The idea was that I
                         would knock on the door, tell them not to worry and not to do
                         anything silly. Then the pirates would tell them to get their hands
                         out and tie them up.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            One by one, every crew member, except for the officer of the
                         watch and an engineer who accompanied two pirates to the engine
                         room, was taken and dumped in the captain's day room.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``Then they took me to the bridge,'' Blyth continued. ``I was
                         still tied up, and then they taped my arms and legs to the chair.
                         They didn't understand how to turn off the automatic pilot, and the
                         pirates were baffled by touch-screen computerized piloting. So I
                         said, 'If you're going to kill me anyway, why should I help?'''
                         Then one of the head pirates told Blyth something that convinced
                         him: the names of his wife and two daughters _ and their street
                         address.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The pirates unbound Blyth long enough for him to alter course,
                         taking the Petro Ranger far from the regularly trafficked corridors
                         of international shipping and into the maritime equivalent of a
                         dark alley. By the time the pirates retaped him to the chair, the
                         ship was still steaming northward but no longer on a course for
                         Vietnam.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The pirates had taped over the portholes, but the captain once
                         saw through a crack in the tape over the bathroom porthole that the
                         bottom half of his ship's identifying blue funnel had been painted
                         red. And could he have seen the stern, he would have found that the
                         Petro Ranger no longer existed. He was now aboard the ``Wilby,''
                         just another vessel bobbing along without notice in international
                         sea lanes. Over the next several days, changes in the weather and
                         the flies buzzing in through the vents were enough to convince
                         Blyth that they were nearing the China coast. Blyth theorized that
                         the pirates intended to meet some black-market tankers to offload
                         the fuel cargo. They would need Blyth and his crew to help make
                         that transfer. But then what?

                         <P>
                            Piracy on the high seas resurfaced in the mid-1980s and in
                         recent years has ratcheted up to a true crisis both for shippers
                         and recreational yachtsmen. In 1989, there were 48 acts of piracy
                         reported around the world; in 1999, there were 285. So far this
                         year, it's up by 40 percent.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The cause of piracy's revival is no different from its
                         appearance centuries ago. Ships serving the top trading nations
                         (England, Holland and Spain in the old days; America, Germany and
                         Japan now) are transiting through a global geography of poverty,
                         envy and desperation. Often these vessels are carrying on board a
                         king's ransom of commodities _ no longer cinnamon, indigo and flax,
                         but jet fuel, alkali and aluminum ingots _ all easily
                         black-marketed into quick money.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Modern piracy ranges from desperate fishermen pulling off petty
                         larcenies at sea to highly organized syndicates slaughtering crews
                         to steal multimillion-dollar vessels. Today's pirates are a
                         troubling symptom of a new world order, one shaped by a fierce
                         Darwinian struggle in the feral markets of modern international
                         trade.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Most piracy is of the mugging-at-sea variety. The pirates just
                         zip up in a speedboat, point a rocket launcher at the hull and
                         demand money. Lately it has been getting a little rougher. Last
                         January, an Australian couple were sailing around the world. In the
                         Gulf of Aden off Yemen, a small powerboat pulled up beside the
                         couple's catamaran; a burst of machine-gun fire tore through the
                         hull, wounding the wife. Four pirates boarded the boat, ripped out
                         some high-tech communications equipment, then left.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Of course, more ambitious pirates realize that stealing some
                         watches and shipboard cash is small stakes when you're dealing with
                         a huge vessel carrying cargo worth millions. Often the pirates will
                         contract with black marketeers to hawk the cargo. And they also
                         want the ship. This may mean repainting it at sea, obtaining fake
                         registration papers and then selling it or just using it themselves
                         to become seemingly legitimate shippers. This process, known as
                         phantom shipping, is costly and dangerous, requiring serious
                         planning and organization.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The more sophisticated forms of piracy are carried out by
                         Southeast Asian syndicates and Chinese triads. According to a 1998
                         report on piracy published by the International Chamber of
                         Commerce, the corporate-style organization of the syndicates is
                         impressive: ships can ``be hijacked to order in the Philippines for
                         about $300,000 and delivered within three days.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The global reaction to the piracy revival has been, by all
                         accounts, slow. So the pirates aren't too scared. Ships disappear
                         pretty regularly and with impunity. Once a ship has been captured,
                         the crew faces one of two fates. In the case of the tanker Global
                         Mars, which was seized by pirates last Feb. 23, the 17 crewmen were
                         bound and blindfolded before being set off in lifeboats. But the 21
                         crew members of the Hualien No. 1, which disappeared with a cargo
                         of river sand last Feb. 28, have never turned up and are now
                         presumed dead. Most seamen know such stories. They hear them and
                         can't believe it will ever happen to them. Ken Blyth was certainly
                         thinking about them when one of the junior pirates told him that
                         their leader wished to see him at once.
