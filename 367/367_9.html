                    <P>
                            The Pirate King
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             Blyth was escorted to his own day room, where the pirates had
                          set up their headquarters. The pirate king was 49 years old, a
                          well-educated and heavyset Indonesian of medium height. He spoke
                          four or five languages, including grammatically perfect English.
                          The pirate king's name, Blyth would learn, was Herman.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             The two men sat down and had a cup of coffee. Blyth was
                          surprised that Herman wanted to chat a little. ``The impression I
                          got,'' Blyth told me, ``was that having achieved what he had done _
                          the Petro Ranger was the most modern tanker he'd swiped _ he would
                          have loved to phone up CNN and say, 'Look what I pulled off.' He
                          was so exhilarated he wanted to share it with someone. I was the
                          only one around who could possibly appreciate what he'd done.''
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             The syndicate he worked for, Herman explained, had five men in
                          leadership positions: one each from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
                          Malaysia and Singapore. He claimed that they had ``inside access''
                          to Petroships, the shipping company. They knew that the Petro
                          Ranger would be sailing with a simple commodity _ fuel _ easily
                          fungible on the black market. They knew the date of embarkation.
                          They knew all about Blyth and most of the crew. Herman had all the
                          documents he would need: registration for the ``Wilby,'' papers
                          that identified Herman as the legitimate captain along with his
                          crew and bills of lading identifying the cargo on board as part of
                          a legitimate charter.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             Blyth was returned to his mattress, quite impressed by the
                          extent of Herman's operation. One thing worried him, though. Why
                          would Herman tell him all this if he didn't also intend to kill
                          him?
                          </P>
                          <P>
                            The Great Escape 
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             After a week, Blyth realized time was running out. Somewhere at
                          sea, two tankers had pulled up alongside for cargo transfers. A
                          third tanker was delayed, Blyth learned. The Petro Ranger idled at
                          sea for several days. Then, on the 13th day of the crew's
                          captivity, one of the pirates made a huge mistake. With the third
                          tanker sailing around unable to find the ``Wilby,'' the No. 2
                          pirate called the tanker on the public VHF frequency. The Chinese
                          heard him.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             Not long afterward, a Chinese patrol vessel stopped, boarded and
                          inspected the Petro Ranger. But Herman handled it smoothly. He
                          locked Blyth and a few of his men down below in crew cabins. He
                          presented papers indicating that he was the captain and passed off
                          both Blyth's legitimate sailors and his own henchmen as his crew.
                          (The pirates kept Blyth's crew in check by routinely reminding them
                          that they knew the whereabouts of their wives and families.)
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             Suspecting a smuggling operation, the Chinese withdrew and
                          waited to see what might happen. When the third tanker did arrive,
                          the Chinese sped in, stopped both ships at sea, and escorted them
                          to Haikou harbor on the island of Hainan in southern China. Since
                          the Chinese were now convinced that the ``Wilby'' was a smuggling
                          ship, Herman quietly contacted his syndicate and got a lawyer to
                          facilitate the usual round robin of bribes. Blyth learned all this
                          from, of course, Herman, who enjoyed summoning the captain back to
                          the day room to boast about his caginess.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             ``I decided I had to get to the Chinese,'' Blyth recalled, ``and
                          then I could only hope that I was in fact getting to the good guys,
                          the ones who weren't corrupt.'' With one of his crew members,
                          Saini, who spoke a little Mandarin, he arranged a midnight meeting
                          with a Chinese lieutenant.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             ``Saini explained who I was,'' Blyth recalled, ``and I gave him
                          my passport and some Malaysian documents stating I had command of
                          the Petro Ranger, which the pirates had neglected to destroy.''
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             The next morning, Chinese soldiers came to the ship and herded
                          first Herman and his ``officers'' and then nearly the entire mix of
                          pirates and legitimate crew onto their boat. Told they were simply
                          going ashore to sign documents granting port clearance, they easily
                          complied as 30 armed soldiers held their weapons at the ready.
                          Blyth then pointed at each man in turn, identifying him as either
                          pirate or crew.
                          </P>

                            Trouble in Port 
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             Not long after the Chinese officials arrested the pirates, Blyth
                          was taken ashore and interrogated by two different law-enforcement
                          agencies: the People's Liberation Army, all dressed in green
                          outfits, and the Public Security Bureau, distinguished by khaki.
                          Days of repetitive interviews and odd accusations _ at one point, a
                          PSB official suggested that Blyth had made the whole pirate thing
                          up _ gave the captain the impression his ship had become ensnared
                          in a major power play. The PLA was deeply concerned with how this
                          might look internationally (and were, therefore, sort of on Blyth's
                          side). The PSB, however, seemed more beholden to provincial powers
                          in southern China, which are widely suspected not only of
                          tolerating piracy but also of organizing it.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             In the end Petroships retrieved its stolen ship _ but the
                          Chinese kept all of the remaining 5,100 tons of fuel, nearly half
                          the original cargo, as ``evidence'' before waiting some time and
                          selling it off.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             Petroships was luckier in some respects that the owners of the
                          Anna Sierra, which was ``saved'' from pirates by the Chinese in
                          1996. In that case, the cargo was sold and the authorities even
                          refused to permit the owners to reclaim the ship. Without care, it
                          took on water and to this day the ship remains beached in Beihai
                          harbor in southern China, a rusting monument to the inadequacy of
                          policing modern piracy.
                          </P>
                          <P>
                             Four months after Blyth went home, the Chinese authorities
                          quietly released Herman and all of his men. The Chinese have
                          refused to explain why they would let the pirates go, as they have
                          done repeatedly in the past.
                          </P>

                             ``One of my old crew members phoned me up in early August,''
                          Blyth said. ``He's still at sea, and he told me that five of our
                          pirates, three of the Malaysians and the two Thais, have been
                          spotted doing piracy again, working the waters between Port Dickson
                          and Port Klang near Kuala Lumpur. You just can't believe it, but
                          they're back out there.''
