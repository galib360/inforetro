                         leg, but he is missing parts of two fingers and an inch of his left
                         leg, shot off in skirmishes with the Philippine Navy.

                         patch when you can snatch a nice pair of imitation Ray Ban

                            Aliasa Bungalos, known and feared as ``Commander Alex'' around
                         the lawless islands and hidden coves that dot the turquoise waters
                         of the Southern Philippines, is a latter-day Captain Kidd.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Guarded by a crew masked in balaclavas and bandannas and
                         brandishing M-16s, Bungalos recently let a journalist visit a
                         deserted island hideout, 11 miles east of the Philippine Navy's
                         southern base in Zamboanga City, for an extraordinary look at the
                         life of a pirate leader. Casually, he described what he does for a
                         living: sneaking up on ships in a fast launch, clambering up ropes
                         to board under cover of night, kidnapping and ransoming victims,
                         selling off the stolen loot.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            He is hardly unique.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Piracy is back with a vengeance, and Bungalos is one of tens of
                         thousands of bandits of the sea who have spurred its resurgence
                         over the past decade. They prey on merchant mariners, fishermen,
                         shippers, even pleasure sailors and scuba divers of all
                         nationalities. Seajacking also poses severe environmental and
                         safety hazards in busy sea lanes. In 1994, two oil tankers collided
                         and burned, killing all aboard, after what was thought to be a
                         pirate attack.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The number of reported pirate attacks has set a record this
                         year, and Asian waters are the new buccaneers' favored haunt. The
                         region's financial crisis, which began three years ago, the
                         political instability and armed insurgencies, and some of the
                         globe's busiest shipping lanes, have made Asia the site of three of
                         four pirate attacks worldwide.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But forget ``Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum.'' Piracy does not
                         fit the Hollywood image of Treasure Island, swashbuckling fun, and
                         talking parrots. Buccaneers who terrorized the Caribbean in the
                         1700s were merciless criminals who forced their victims to walk the
                         plank while they stole a ship and its cargo.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Modern pirates are sometimes members of sophisticated crime
                         syndicates who use global positioning systems, satellite phones,
                         falsified papers, and powerful speedboats to pull off
                         multimillion-dollar heists of tankers and cargo ships. But more
                         often they are hit-and-run bandits in motorized dinghies who prey
                         on fishermen, ferries, and yachtsmen, robbing them of any valuables
                         aboard. Bungalos's gang is one of these.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            What's common to almost all of these attacks is their
                         ruthlessness, the use of deadly weapons _ from knives and handguns
                         to antitank rockets and mortars _ and the cost to the maritime
                         world in lives, cargo, and ships.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            With 90 percent of the world's trade moving by ship, and nearly
                         half of it passing through Asia's pirate-infested waters, the
                         threat to global commerce is growing. Estimates of the cost of
                         piracy and maritime fraud run to more than $16 billion a year.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The pettiest incidents are essentially maritime muggings by
                         those who subsist by stealing fish, mooring lines, or cans of
                         paint.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The most serious are meticulously planned attacks in which
                         organized crime gangs target valuable cargo, resell it in advance,
                         and prepare fake registration papers for a ship.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In the worst cases, pirates kill the crew, repaint and rename
                         the vessel, and use the ``phantom ship'' to attack other vessels or
                         to steal millions of dollars of cargo from unsuspecting shippers
                         who unwittingly hire the pirates' fly-by-night company to transport
                         their goods.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Shipowners reported 300 attacks or attempted attacks in 1999 to
                         the International Maritime Bureau, an industry watchdog, and 309 to
                         the United Nations' International Maritime Organization. But the
                         Maritime Bureau says the figures understate, by at least half, the
                         true picture.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In figures compiled for the Globe, the Philippine Navy and coast
                         guard cited 28 pirate attacks in the first six months of this year.
                         The International Maritime Bureau recorded just one in Philippine
                         waters, based on reports from shipowners.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Why the discrepancy? Cargo ships often do not report minor
                         attacks because they fear being detained by investigators; every
                         day in port costs thousands. Captains and shipowners sometimes
                         cover up attacks to protect their reputations. Coastal ships and
                         fishermen, meanwhile, report only to local authorities _ or not at
                         all, if they fear retribution.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But the danger is growing. So far this year, reports of pirate
                         attacks have jumped 40 percent over the first half of 1999,
                         according to the Maritime Bureau.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Indonesian waters are by far the world's most dangerous, with
                         115 incidents reported in 1999, almost double the figure for the
                         year before.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Last year, 408 seamen were taken hostage, a jump of 67 percent
                         from 1998.
                         </P>

                            As far back as 800 BC, sea bandits have plagued waters from
                         Taiwan to New Guinea, from Madagascar to Australasia, said a
                         Philippine Navy captain, Omar Tonsay, who has chronicled maritime
                         raids in the region.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Bandits of the Sulu Sea, in what is now the Southern
                         Philippines, have long been reputed to be among the most vicious.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            But Tonsay says that what 16th-century colonizers branded
                         ``piracy'' was for locals ``a tradition _ economic livelihood for
                         men and women, a rite of passage.''

                            Islands provide pirates with countless safe hideouts. The
                         tangled branches of wild mangroves, and the shallow around Sacol
                         Island keep Bungalos and his gang out of sight and out of the reach
                         of the law. Dragging on a counterfeit Marlboro and showing off his
                         bullet scars, Bungalos recounted his resume while a Navy gunboat
                         patrolled not a mile away.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Late one night, he and 12 of his gang used motorboats to attack
                         the Randy-Mar, a commercial fishing boat that had been preparing to
                         cast out its nets. They used the ship's anchor line to hoist
                         themselves aboard and stole fish-detecting sonar, ship radios, and
                         three guns, which they sold for 80,000 Philippine pesos ($1,778).
                         Another time, three of his men boarded the Magnolia ferry as
                         passengers and took the captain at gunpoint.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            They then threw ropes to seven accomplices in a launch below,
                         who shinnied on deck to steal cash, watches, jewelry, even clothes
                         from terrified passengers and crew.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Bungalos's men have used speedy outriggers to zoom into coastal
                         towns and to snatch victims whose families could pay, including the
                         13-year-old daughter of a gas station owner. After holding her for
                         three months on Sacol Island, a pirates' lair where, Bungalos said,
                         ``she was not touched, raped, or harmed,'' he negotiated $8,000 in
                         ransom and got ``three sacks of rice as thanks when we released the
                         girl.'' It's a lot more than the $55 a month he can make as a
                         seaweed farmer.
