                    <h2> Cambodia Denies Piracy Charges Against Soldiers </h2>
                    <P>
                            BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia denied that 11 of
                            its soldiers had been engaged in piracy in Thai waters and
                            dismissed piracy charges made against them by Thai authorities.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The soldiers could not be charged with piracy because they were
                            only carrying out their duties, Cambodia's Koh Kong Governor Rung
                            Pramkesorn said, according to the local press today.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The 11 Cambodian soldiers were arrested by the Thai Navy off
                            Thailand's eastern coast on Sunday.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The soldiers were reportedly seized along with their patrol
                            boat by the Thai Navy after a brief clash off the eastern coastal
                            province of Trat, when they were allegedly attempting to rob a
                            Thai trawler.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The Thai side said that the trawler was in Thai territorial
                            waters and that the Cambodian soldiers would face charges of
                            illegal entry, illegal possession and use of weapons, piracy,
                            resisting arrest and illegal use of radio communication.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            However, the soldiers claimed that the Thai trawler was fishing
                            in Cambodian waters.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            Governor Pramkesorn also accused the trawler of illegally
                            fishing in Cambodian waters.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The soldiers currently are detained at a police station in Trat
                            province and they will soon be transferred to the Trat Prison.
                            </P>
