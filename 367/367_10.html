                    <h2> Water Pollution Caused by Sunken Boat Brought under Control </h2>
                    <P>
                            BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Water pollution on east China's
                            Bohai Sea, caused by leaking oil from a sunken fishing boat, has
                            been brought under control, according to sources with the China
                            Maritime Search and Rescue Center (CMSRC).
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The "Zhepuyuyou 31" boat was carrying 480-tons of engine oil
                            when it collided in thick fog with a ship of an unidentified
                            nationality in the early morning of May 1.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The boat was seriously damaged in the middle part of its body,
                            allowing the oil to leak.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The boat's 11 crewmen escaped from the sinking boat after the
                            collision, and were rescued by a nearby vessel.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The rescue center asked its branches in Liaoning and Shandong
                            provinces, which are closest to the spot, to recover the boat as
                            soon as possible, after it was informed of the collision.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            But rescue work was delayed because of heavy fog. A Chinese
                            Navy "631" submarine arrived at the spot on the afternoon of May
                            1, and found that the fishing boat had sunk below the surface.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            The submarine also detected a two kilometer long and 200 meter
                            wide oil slick near the spot, which continued to grow as oil
                            poured out from the boat.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            About 15 ships and an airplane were mobilized by CMSRC to the
                            spot, helping clean the oil floating on the surface of the
                            sea. But there were many other ships and vessels sailing through
                            the polluted waters nearby, hampering the clean-up operation.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                            All of the located oil slicks have been cleaned, but the
                            rescue vessels are trying to find whether there are other new oil
                            slicks, in order to ensure all the polluted waters are cleaned.
                            </P>
