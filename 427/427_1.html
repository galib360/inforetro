                                ATLANTA _ Shirl Jennings doesn't look people in the eye when he
                             talks to them, which is disconcerting. But he isn't being rude or
                             shy.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                He can see, all right. He just hasn't gotten used to making eye
                             contact during a conversation. He forgets to look down, too, for
                             curbs and chairs and other obstacles below eye level.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                When he was blind, as he was for most of his 58 years, he never
                             had to worry about such things.
                             </P>

                                ``I'm so used to looking straight ahead,'' the Conyers (Ga.)
                             resident said good-humoredly. ``Being blind was more easy
                             sometimes.''

                                Jennings is among the 20 or so people ever known to have
                             regained their eyesight after lifelong blindness. A professional
                             masseur, he was blind for more than 40 years until two operations
                             in 1991 restored his sight.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                His extraordinary metamorphosis made headlines at the time and
                             was the subject of a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, ``To
                             See or Not See,'' by neurologist Oliver Sacks. His experiences also
                             inspired the movie romance ``At First Sight,'' starring Val Kilmer
                             and Mira Sorvino, which opens Friday in Atlanta theaters.
                             </P>

                                Don't expect the movie to tell Jennings' life story _ key
                             elements have been altered, Hollywood-style. The film is set in New
                             York instead of metro Atlanta, and the main characters are much
                             younger than Jennings and his wife, Barbara, who is 51.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                Yet the Jenningses say the movie is surprisingly accurate on
                             what is to them the most crucial point: For those who have learned
                             to live without it, the gift of eyesight can be a tremendous,
                             overwhelming burden.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                When Jennings regained his eyesight, his doctors discovered he
                             had lost virtually all visual memory. His eyes were functioning,
                             yet the visual cues he was receiving seemed at odds with the
                             sounds, smells and textures that for decades had been his means of
                             observing the world.
                             </P>

                                Faces were meaningless blurs; airplanes flying at 30,000 feet
                             seemed to skim inches over his head. He could not recognize a whole
                             tree, let alone a forest.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                ``He knew the top and bottom separately, the trunk, the
                             leaves,'' Mrs. Jennings said. ``It took him 6 months to put a tree
                             together.''
                             </P>

                                He faced other adjustments no one had anticipated. As a masseur
                             for 25 years at the DeKalb YMCA (Ga.), Jennings had felt secure in
                             his familiarity with skin and hair, muscle and bone.
                             </P>

                                ``He came home to me one day and growled, `I can see the bodies
                             I'm working on, and I don't like it!' '' Barbara laughed.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                There were laughs, but far more frustrations.

                                Born in 1940 in Bedford County, Va., Shirley Jennings was a
                             lively toddler until age 3, when he became dangerously ill with
                             three illnesses at once: meningitis, polio and cat scratch fever.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                His sickness plunged him into a coma, from which he emerged
                             after two weeks with paralyzed legs and damaged eyesight. Jennings'
                             determined 17-year-old mother got his cousins to help him relearn
                             how to crawl and walk, a process that took two or three years and
                             ultimately succeeded.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                But his eyesight continued to deteriorate. When he was 7 or 8,
                             Jennings was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive,
                             untreatable disease of the retina that causes blindness. By the
                             time he was 10, he could distinguish only light from dark.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                From then on, Jennings learned to live sightless. He attended
                             the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in Staunton, Va., and
                             later the YMCA School of Swedish Massage.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                He learned to recognize people by their footfalls, by the feel
                             of their skin. Fellow blind masseurs passed along clients' more
                             unusual characteristics, such as a hairy foot, and when Jennings
                             encountered these people on his massage table, he astonished them
                             by identifying them by name.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                Over the decades, he became resigned to his blindness, as
                             consistency at work and at home taught him contentment. That began
                             to change in the late 1980s when he heard that an old girlfriend,
                             Barbara, whom he had dated two decades earlier, had divorced her
                             husband and returned to Atlanta.

                             <P>
                                ``I called,'' Jennings said. ``She had a beautiful, distinctive
                             voice. After 20 years, we were right back where we were before.''
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                ``He said he wouldn't let me get away this time,'' Mrs. Jennings
                             said.
                             </P>

                                In 1991, soon after they started dating again, she urged
                             Jennings to visit her family ophthalmologist in Dunwoody (Ga.), Dr.
                             Trevor Woodhams. Jennings hadn't been to an eye doctor in 10 years,
                             thinking it futile. But she was adamant that he seek a fresh
                             opinion.
                             </P>

                                ``He had already reconciled himself to the fact that he would
                             never see again,'' Woodhams recalled. ``He was humoring Barbara,
                             that was how it appeared to me.''
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                Nonetheless, Woodhams was interested. Jennings had extremely
                             dense cataracts, so opaque it was impossible to determine the
                             condition of his retinas, supposedly degraded beyond repair by
                             retinitis pigmentosa.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                Surprisingly, tests of the optic nerves showed they were still
                             viable.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                ``He had the capacity of some vision,'' Woodhams said. ``How
                             much was anybody's guess.''
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                Woodhams speculated that removing the cataracts might restore
                             Jennings' eyesight. Jennings was hesitant, saying it was too much
                             trouble and expense for such a small chance of return.
                             </P>
                             <P>
                                ``But Barbara's attitude was, if there's any chance at all,
                             let's go for it,'' Woodhams said.
                             </P>

                                Mrs. Jennings' intensely bright blue eyes don't so much as
                             twinkle as she downplays her role in her husband's decision.

                                ``I had to stay out of it,'' she insisted. ``He had to live with
                             it.''
                             </P>

                                ``It was worth a gamble,'' Jennings said with a nod.
                             </P>

                                Woodhams spends most Monday mornings in surgical scrubs,
                             performing cataract removal operations at the surgical center
                             adjoining his Dunwoody clinic.
                             </P>

                                The procedure has not changed drastically in the seven years
                             since he used it to restore Jennings' eyesight. One difference is
                             that Woodhams now uses a local anesthetic that allows the patient
                             to see as soon as a few hours after surgery. In Jennings' case, he
                             used a shot that temporarily paralyzed the optic nerve, which kept
                             them from learning the outcome until the next day.

                                Watching Woodhams in surgery is marvelous. His hands, small and
                             finely shaped, are all that moves when he operates; the rest of his
                             body remains absolutely still, his torso upright and his eyes
                             locked onto the microscope that magnifies the patient's eye to
                             roughly 20 times actual size.

                                Using an ultrasound tool he describes as a tiny jackhammer,
                             Woodhams scrapes away the existing lens. Through the microscope,
                             one can see the instrument plowing minuscule furrows in the lens,
                             gradually revealing the clear pupil beneath.

                                Woodhams inserts a minute tube within the thin membrane covering
                             the eye and deftly implants the new artificial lens. Then he gently
                             nudges the iris back into shape around the lens. No stitches are
                             required.

                                The entire operation takes no more than half an hour. Woodhams
                             shrugs out of his sterile gown, stuffs his surgical cap in the
                             pocket of his scrubs and recalls how Jennings' first operation in
                             September 1991, to remove the cataract in the right eye, was
                             nothing heroic.
