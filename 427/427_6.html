                    <P>
                            The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
                         unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
                         mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
                         or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
                         _ can be life-threatening.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
                         minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
                          </P>
                          <P>SOLAR MENACE 
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
                         sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
                         according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
                         Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
                         culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
                         damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
                         firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
                         melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
                         active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
                         basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
                         windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
                         glass -- or apply sunscreen.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
                         sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
                         sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
                         blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
                         sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
                         by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
                         least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
                         tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
                         face.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
                         contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
                         Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
                         cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
                         </P>
                         <P>SUN AND EYES
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
                         photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
                         directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
                         thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
                         eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
                         percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
                         100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
                         up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
                          </P>
                          <P>SUN AND DEHYDRATION 
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
                         and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
                         stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
                         or prickly heat.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
                         its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
                         breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
                         since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
                         best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
                         body with water until the ambulance arrives.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
                         and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
                         skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
                         appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
                         can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
                         outdoors.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
                         off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
                         your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
                         symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
                         hospital.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
                         the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
                         wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
                         showers.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
                         powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
                         baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
                         will help the body replenish lost liquids.
