                                    ATLANTA _ Shirl Jennings doesn't look people in the eye when he
                                 talks to them, which is disconcerting. But he isn't being rude or
                                 shy.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    He can see, all right. He just hasn't gotten used to making eye
                                 contact during a conversation. He forgets to look down, too, for
                                 curbs and chairs and other obstacles below eye level.
                                 </P>

                                    When he was blind, as he was for most of his 58 years, he never
                                 had to worry about such things.
                                 </P>

                                    ``I'm so used to looking straight ahead,'' the Conyers (Ga.)
                                 resident said good-humoredly. ``Being blind was more easy
                                 sometimes.''
                                 </P>

                                    Jennings is among the 20 or so people ever known to have
                                 regained their eyesight after lifelong blindness. A professional
                                 masseur, he was blind for more than 40 years until two operations
                                 in 1991 restored his sight.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    His extraordinary metamorphosis made headlines at the time and
                                 was the subject of a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, ``To
                                 See or Not See,'' by neurologist Oliver Sacks. His experiences also
                                 inspired the movie romance ``At First Sight,'' starring Val Kilmer
                                 and Mira Sorvino, which opens Friday in Atlanta theaters.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Don't expect the movie to tell Jennings' life story _ key
                                 elements have been altered, Hollywood-style. The film is set in New
                                 York instead of metro Atlanta, and the main characters are much
                                 younger than Jennings and his wife, Barbara, who is 51.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Yet the Jenningses say the movie is surprisingly accurate on
                                 what is to them the most crucial point: For those who have learned
                                 to live without it, the gift of eyesight can be a tremendous,
                                 overwhelming burden.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    When Jennings regained his eyesight, his doctors discovered he
                                 had lost virtually all visual memory. His eyes were functioning,
                                 yet the visual cues he was receiving seemed at odds with the
                                 sounds, smells and textures that for decades had been his means of
                                 observing the world.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Faces were meaningless blurs; airplanes flying at 30,000 feet
                                 seemed to skim inches over his head. He could not recognize a whole
                                 tree, let alone a forest.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``He knew the top and bottom separately, the trunk, the
                                 leaves,'' Mrs. Jennings said. ``It took him 6 months to put a tree
                                 together.''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    He faced other adjustments no one had anticipated. As a masseur
                                 for 25 years at the DeKalb YMCA (Ga.), Jennings had felt secure in
                                 his familiarity with skin and hair, muscle and bone.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``He came home to me one day and growled, `I can see the bodies
                                 I'm working on, and I don't like it!' '' Barbara laughed.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    There were laughs, but far more frustrations.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Born in 1940 in Bedford County, Va., Shirley Jennings was a
                                 lively toddler until age 3, when he became dangerously ill with
                                 three illnesses at once: meningitis, polio and cat scratch fever.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    His sickness plunged him into a coma, from which he emerged
                                 after two weeks with paralyzed legs and damaged eyesight. Jennings'
                                 determined 17-year-old mother got his cousins to help him relearn
                                 how to crawl and walk, a process that took two or three years and
                                 ultimately succeeded.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    But his eyesight continued to deteriorate. When he was 7 or 8,
                                 Jennings was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive,
                                 untreatable disease of the retina that causes blindness. By the
                                 time he was 10, he could distinguish only light from dark.
                                 </P>
