                    <P>
                            From then on, Jennings learned to live sightless. He attended
                         the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in Staunton, Va., and
                         later the YMCA School of Swedish Massage.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            He learned to recognize people by their footfalls, by the feel
                         of their skin. Fellow blind masseurs passed along clients' more
                         unusual characteristics, such as a hairy foot, and when Jennings
                         encountered these people on his massage table, he astonished them
                         by identifying them by name.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Over the decades, he became resigned to his blindness, as
                         consistency at work and at home taught him contentment. That began
                         to change in the late 1980s when he heard that an old girlfriend,
                         Barbara, whom he had dated two decades earlier, had divorced her
                         husband and returned to Atlanta.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I called,'' Jennings said. ``She had a beautiful, distinctive
                         voice. After 20 years, we were right back where we were before.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``He said he wouldn't let me get away this time,'' Mrs. Jennings
                         said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            In 1991, soon after they started dating again, she urged
                         Jennings to visit her family ophthalmologist in Dunwoody (Ga.), Dr.
                         Trevor Woodhams. Jennings hadn't been to an eye doctor in 10 years,
                         thinking it futile. But she was adamant that he seek a fresh
                         opinion.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``He had already reconciled himself to the fact that he would
                         never see again,'' Woodhams recalled. ``He was humoring Barbara,
                         that was how it appeared to me.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Nonetheless, Woodhams was interested. Jennings had extremely
                         dense cataracts, so opaque it was impossible to determine the
                         condition of his retinas, supposedly degraded beyond repair by
                         retinitis pigmentosa.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Surprisingly, tests of the optic nerves showed they were still
                         viable.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``He had the capacity of some vision,'' Woodhams said. ``How
                         much was anybody's guess.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Woodhams speculated that removing the cataracts might restore
                         Jennings' eyesight. Jennings was hesitant, saying it was too much
                         trouble and expense for such a small chance of return.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``But Barbara's attitude was, if there's any chance at all,
                         let's go for it,'' Woodhams said.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Mrs. Jennings' intensely bright blue eyes don't so much as
                         twinkle as she downplays her role in her husband's decision.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``I had to stay out of it,'' she insisted. ``He had to live with
                         it.''
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            ``It was worth a gamble,'' Jennings said with a nod.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Woodhams spends most Monday mornings in surgical scrubs,
                         performing cataract removal operations at the surgical center
                         adjoining his Dunwoody clinic.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The procedure has not changed drastically in the seven years
                         since he used it to restore Jennings' eyesight. One difference is
                         that Woodhams now uses a local anesthetic that allows the patient
                         to see as soon as a few hours after surgery. In Jennings' case, he
                         used a shot that temporarily paralyzed the optic nerve, which kept
                         them from learning the outcome until the next day.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Watching Woodhams in surgery is marvelous. His hands, small and
                         finely shaped, are all that moves when he operates; the rest of his
                         body remains absolutely still, his torso upright and his eyes
                         locked onto the microscope that magnifies the patient's eye to
                         roughly 20 times actual size.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Using an ultrasound tool he describes as a tiny jackhammer,
                         Woodhams scrapes away the existing lens. Through the microscope,
                         one can see the instrument plowing minuscule furrows in the lens,
                         gradually revealing the clear pupil beneath.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            Woodhams inserts a minute tube within the thin membrane covering
                         the eye and deftly implants the new artificial lens. Then he gently
                         nudges the iris back into shape around the lens. No stitches are
                         required.
                         </P>
                         <P>
                            The entire operation takes no more than half an hour. Woodhams
                         shrugs out of his sterile gown, stuffs his surgical cap in the
                         pocket of his scrubs and recalls how Jennings' first operation in
                         September 1991, to remove the cataract in the right eye, was
                         nothing heroic.
