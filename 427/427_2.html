                            SUNS MAY LOSE BET THEY COULD KEEP STAR  </h2>

                            <P>
                                    With the start of training camp looming early next week, the
                                 Suns and many of the NBA's other 28 teams can do nothing but wait
                                 patiently while Phoenix free agent star Antonio McDyess makes up
                                 his mind.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    It appears that McDyess will decide between the Suns and his old
                                 club, the Denver Nuggets. The Nuggets might have the edge, even
                                 though the Suns can pay more.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The Houston Rockets still are interested but apparently are
                                 zeroing in on Chicago Bulls free agent Scottie Pippen. Orlando
                                 apparently has tried to enter the McDyess sweepstakes, and Chicago
                                 Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause is making a strong drive for
                                 him.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    McDyess, Pippen and Minnesota free agent Tom Gugliotta are the
                                 most attractive players on the market, and until their decisions
                                 are made, very little else can fall into place.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The Suns have not given McDyess any kind of deadline, said one
                                 of McDyess' agents, James Bryant.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``I think everyone wants to know what's going on as soon as
                                 possible,'' Bryant said. ``But there haven't been any demands. We
                                 don't know when Antonio is going to make a decision. We feel like
                                 it's all starting to crystallize. I'd expect one pretty soon.''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The NBA deal is expected to be finalized Monday or Tuesday,
                                 which will bring a wave of free agent signings.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The Suns would like an answer as quickly as possible, Bryant
                                 said, to determine where they go next if McDyess leaves. And those
                                 options may be drying up.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    League sources said Thursday that Gugliotta has come to terms
                                 with the Timberwolves. Minnesota still could sign him and make a
                                 trade, but either way, the Suns apparently are out of the picture.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    So where do they go if Gugliotta is off the board and McDyess is
                                 holding a news conference in Denver?
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Because of the new collective bargaining rules, few options
                                 remain. League sources said that Chicago center Luc Longley is
                                 ready to make a deal with Phoenix.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The Suns probably would make an offer to their own free agent
                                 forward, Clifford Robinson, who has had an offer from the Detroit
                                 Pistons.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Then the Suns still could go after another, less expensive free
                                 agent such as Miami's Brent Barry, whom the club wanted to draft in
                                 1995.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Sign-and-trade scenarios are possible, but most teams probably
                                 would want the Suns' first-round draft pick obtained from Dallas
                                 last summer in the trade that sent Steve Nash to the Mavericks. The
                                 Suns might be better off holding on to that chip.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The Suns gambled in October 1997 when they traded guard Wesley
                                 Person, forward Tony Dumas and four draft picks _ two first- and
                                 two second-round selections _ in a three-team deal with Cleveland
                                 and Denver, to get the 6-foot-10, 220-pound McDyess.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    The risk was that the club might not be able to re-sign McDyess
                                 when he became a free agent at the end of the season.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Why would McDyess consider the Nuggets, a team that won 11 games
                                 last season?
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    First, the Nuggets fired General Manager Allan Bristow, who
                                 traded McDyess and said he wasn't worth a $100 million contract.
                                 McDyess said last season that he would not consider playing in
                                 Denver again if Bristow were there. He was replaced by Dan Issel,
                                 whom McDyess likes.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Second, the Nuggets traded for Nick Van Exel. McDyess and Van
                                 Exel have become friends, and there is speculation that he will
                                 agree to go to Denver if the Nuggets give Van Exel a new deal next
                                 summer when his contract is up. By the way, they have the same
                                 agents.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Third, McDyess is a small-town guy who still feels connected
                                 with some of his friends in Denver and would feel comfortable with
                                 Van Exel around. His two closest friends with the Suns were Nash,
                                 who was traded, and John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, who won't be
                                 re-signed.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Finally, it's possible McDyess never wanted to leave the Nuggets
                                 in the first place. He fired his last agent, Arn Tellem, and hired
                                 Bryant and Tony Dutt, reportedly because Tellem forced a trade from
                                 Denver by demanding a $100 million contract from the Nuggets.
                                 Tellem apparently didn't tell McDyess what the Nuggets had on the
                                 table.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Bryant said McDyess likes the Phoenix organization, Coach Danny
                                 Ainge and his teammates with the Suns, who apparently have been
                                 letting him know they want him back.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    ``It's just a different situation with these new rules,'' Bryant
                                 said. ``It's almost like choosing a college now. The money is about
                                 the same wherever he goes. You have to consider a lot more factors,
                                 like the style of play, the makeup of the team, how you fit into
                                 the plan, how competitive the team has a chance to be. There is a
                                 lot to consider.''
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    McDyess could not be reached for comment. A friend who is
                                 screening calls made to McDyess' home and cellular numbers said
                                 McDyess will not speak with reporters until he has made his
                                 decision.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    If the Suns renounce the rights to McDyess, they will be about
                                 $10.7 million below the salary cap if they keep their five contract
                                 players and do not renounce Robinson, Rex Chapman and Marko Milic.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Robinson reportedly has been offered a contract by the Detroit
                                 Pistons, but if McDyess leaves, the Suns likely would offer him
                                 some of their available cap space to keep him in Phoenix.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    Still, McDyess would be a huge loss.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    McDyess was arguably the Suns' best player over the last month
                                 of the 1997-98 season and during a first-round playoff loss to the
                                 San Antonio Spurs.
                                 </P>
                                 <P>
                                    During April, in which the Suns were 8-1, he averaged 19.3
                                 points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.1 blocked shots and 1.89 steals, and shot
                                 62.2 percent.
                                 </P>

                                    For the season, he averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds and
                                 joined Alvan Adams and Garfield Heard as the only Suns to have at
                                 least 100 blocked shots and 100 steals in a season. &QL;
