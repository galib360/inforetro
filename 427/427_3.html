                        WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six years of research have produced little  
                    hard evidence that the magnetic fields around electric power lines 
                    cause cancer, yet some lingering concerns remain, a National 
                    Institutes of Health division reported Tuesday. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        ``Virtually all of the laboratory evidence in animals and humans  
                    and most of the mechanistic studies in cells fail to support a 
                    causal relationship'' between the electromagnetic fields and 
                    cancer, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 
                    said in the report to Congress. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        However, it said there have been some statistical associations  
                    between the fields and childhood leukemia as well as chronic 
                    lymphocytic leukemia in adults exposed to the fields through their 
                    work, such as electric utility workers, machinists and welders. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Research is continuing on these ``lingering concerns'' and  
                    efforts to reduce human exposure to electromagnetic fields should 
                    continue, the report said. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        ``The lack of consistent, positive findings in animal or  
                    mechanistic studies weakens the belief that this association is 
                    actually due to EMF, but it cannot completely discount the 
                    epidemiological findings,'' NIEHS Director Kenneth Olden said in a 
                    statement. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Therefore, he said, since virtually everyone in the country is  
                    routinely exposed to EMF, efforts to reduce such exposure should 
                    continue. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        For example, the electrical industry should continue efforts to  
                    reduce the electromagnetic fields around large transmission lines 
                    and communities should enforce electrical codes to avoid wiring 
                    errors that can increase EMF. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        The focus on a possible link to cancer stemmed from a 1979  
                    Denver study that tied leukemia to EMF, but the researchers also 
                    concluded that there was no connection between EMF and other 
                    problems including Alzheimer's disease, depression and birth 
                    defects. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Just a year ago, a panel of scientists studying this issue  
                    concluded, in a 19-9 vote, that electromagnetic fields should be 
                    considered ``possible human carcinogens'' though the risk was 
                    ``probably quite small.'' 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        That was at odds with a 1996 report by a National Research  
                    Council panel of scientists.Those scientists evaluated about 500 
                    studies on the health effects of high voltage power lines and found 
                    ``no conclusive and consistent evidence'' that electric and 
                    magnetic fields cause any human disease. 
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Though the link between electricity and disease has long been  
                    controversial, some consumer groups have sued power companies or 
                    forced utility firms to move power lines or install shielding.
