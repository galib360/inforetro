 <h2> Govt: Researcher Faked Cancer Data </h2>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A scientist whose 1992 study linking  
high-voltage power lines to cancer contributed to public fears was 
found to have faked his data and has left the Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard P. Liburdy had claimed to have found a link between the  
electromagnetic fields around power lines and certain cellular 
changes in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	After a whistle-blower complained, the federal Office of  
Research Integrity investigated and concluded that Liburdy had 
committed scientific misconduct by tossing out data that did not 
support his conclusions, said the agency's director, Chris Pascal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence demonstrates Liburdy knew his data manipulations  
were significant to the conclusions of the paper,'' the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy, a 51-year-old cellular biologist who lives in Tiburon,  
outside San Francisco, resigned his 15-year position in March after 
losing his funding, the San Francisco Chronicle said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, he agreed to ask the scientific journals that published  
his work to retract three key graphs. Liburdy, who had received 
$3.3 million in federal grants for his research, also agreed to a 
three-year ban on receiving federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a letter in last month's issue of the journal  
Science, he denied doing anything wrong other than failing to 
explain his graphing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``My scientific conclusions stand as published,'' Liburdy wrote.  
``I admit no scientific wrongdoing. I could not afford a protracted 
legal battle with the ORI, and a settlement was reached by which I 
admit no liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three independent scientists who evaluated the facts at  
Liburdy's request supported him, the Chronicle reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Liburdy did not respond Friday to a request for comment faxed to  
his home by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that electromagnetic fields can cause childhood  
leukemia and other illnesses has raised fears among people living 
near high-tension power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory had been raised well before Liburdy's study, but he  
found what was thought to be the first plausible biological 
explanation for such a connection. However, at least 20 subsequent 
studies failed to find any conclusive link of the sort he 
described. 
</P>
<P>
	Some statistical studies that looked at the rate of cancer among  
people living near power lines have indicated that it is more 
common among those exposed to electromagnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the National Institute of Environmental Health  
Science, virtually all of the laboratory studies of animals and 
humans ``fail to support a causal relationship.'' At the same time, 
the agency has said that invisible fields created by power lines 
``cannot be recognized as entirely safe.''
