<h2> Sepa Warns Against TV, Radio Radiation </h2>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Radio and television have become
another major source of urban pollution through the powerful
impact of electromagnetic radiation, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The warning was based on the results of the latest national
investigation conducted by the State Environmental Protection
Administration (Sepa) over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of wireless communication, high-voltage
power grids and the ever-increasing volume of electronic products
used at home or in offices and hospitals have exposed the public
to a large quantity of electromagnetic waves, according to Sepa
Minister Xie Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
Xie has called for the introduction of legislative measures to
limit radiations to their lowest possible level.
</P>
<P>
Electromagnetic pollution control should become a major concern
in China's environmental protection program, and be listed on the
work agenda of local governments, Xie said yesterday at a national
meeting in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
All electrical products are artificial sources of
electromagnetic waves. When this radiation becomes too powerful,
it can harm people's health, said Zhao Yamin, an official with
Sepa.
</P>
<P>
The impact of environmental electromagnetic radiation is still
within international standards in most parts of China, and has not
yet become a serious environmental risk, said Zhang Zhigang, a
Sepa expert.
</P>
<P>
The two-year (1997-98) investigation has found that the country
currently has a total of 10,235 television and radio broadcasting
transmitters, with a total capacity of 130,000 kilowatts.
