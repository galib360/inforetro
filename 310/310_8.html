<h2> S.Korean Scientists Discover Brain Cell Regenerator </h2>

<P>
SEOUL, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean scientists have
discovered a new substance that protects and regenerates brain
cells in rats, raising hopes of fighting degenerative brain
diseases, said a report in the latest issue of the "Journal of
Neurochemistry."
</P>
<P>
A research team at Seoul National University, led by Professor
Suh Yoo-hun, has found that a chemical called dehydroevodiamine (
DHED) extracted from natural herbs is efficient in deterring
memory loss and preventing cerebral apoplexy from destroying brain
cells during tests with rats.
</P>
<P>
Its test also showed that the material can restore normal
function to damaged brain nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
"The research is in its early stages of development. But with
this initial success, the prospects of curing a wide range of
brain diseases have brightened," Suh said.
</P>
<P>
Suh expects the material can be developed into a new medicine
to prevent and cure human brain diseases caused by the loss of
brain cells, such as Alzheimer's Disease, cerebral apoplexy and
dementia.
</P>
<P>
The scientists experimented with rats whose brain function was
damaged by cerebral apoplexy.
</P>
<P>
The rats' brain function markedly improved seven days after
introducing the substance.
</P>
<P>
The team has almost completed testing with animals on the
material's effectiveness and toxicity and plans to follow up with
pre-clinical experiments by the end of April this year.
